Anystyle-Parser is a very fast and smart parser for academic references. It
is inspired by [ParsCit](http://aye.comp.nus.edu.sg/parsCit/) and
[FreeCite](http://freecite.library.brown.edu/); Anystyle-Parser uses machine
learning algorithms and is designed
for raw speed (it uses [wapiti](https://github.com/inukshuk/wapiti-ruby) based
conditional random fields and [Kyoto Cabinet](http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/)
or [Redis](http://redis.io) as a key-value store), flexibility (it is easy to
train the model with data that is relevant to your parsing needs), and
compatibility (Anystyle-Parser exports to Ruby Hashes, BibTeX, or the
CSL/CiteProc JSON format).

Web Application and Web Service
-------------------------------
Anystyle-Parser is available as a web application and a web service at
[http://anystyle.io](http://anystyle.io). For example Ruby code using
the anystyle.io API, see this [prototype](https://gist.github.com/inukshuk/f1d47aeab1f778bca8ce)
for a style predictor.

Installation
------------

    $ [sudo] gem install anystyle-parser

During the statistical analysis of reference strings, Anystyle-Parser relies
on a large feature dictionary; by default, Anystyle-Parser creates a
[Kyoto Cabinet](http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/) file-based hash database
from the dictionary file that ships with the parser. If Kyoto Cabinet is
not installed on your system, Anystyle-Parser uses a simple Ruby Hash as a
fall-back; this Hash has to be re-created every time you load the parser
and takes up a lot of memory in your Ruby process; it is therefore strongly
recommended to install Kyoto Cabinet and the `kyotocabinet-ruby` gem.

    $ [sudo] gem install kyotocabinet-ruby

The database file will be created the first time you access the dictionary;
note that you will need write permissions in the directory where the file
is to be created. You can change the Dictionary's default path in the
Dictionary's options:

    Anystyle::Parser::Dictionary.instance.options[:cabinet]

Starting with version 0.1.0, Anystyle-Parser also supports
[Redis](http://redis.io); to use Redis as the data store you need to install
the `redis` and `redis-namespace` gems (optionally, the `hiredis` gem).

    $ [sudo] gem install redis redis-namespace

To see which data store modes are available in you current environment,
check the output of `Dictionary.modes`:

    > Anystyle::Parser::Dictionary.modes
    => [:kyoto, :redis, :hash]

To select one of the available modes, use the dictionary instance options:

    > Anystyle.dictionary.options[:mode]
    => :kyoto

To use [Redis](http://redis.io) you also need to set the host or unix socket
where your redis server is available. For example:

    Anystyle.dictionary.options[:mode] = :redis
    Anystyle.dictionary.options[:host] = 'localhost'

When the data store is opened using redis-mode and the data store is empty,
the feature dictionary will be imported automatically. If you want to import
the data explicitly you can use `Dictionary#create` after setting the
required options.


Usage
-----

### Parsing

You can access the main Anystyle-Parser instance at `Anystyle.parser`;
the `#parse` method is also available via `Anystyle.parse`. For more complex
requirements (e.g., if you need multiple Parser instances simultaneously) you
can create your own instances from the `Anystyle::Parser::Parser` class.

The two fundamental methods you need to know about in order to use
Anystyle-Parser are `#parse` and `#train` that both accept two arguments.

    Parser#parse(input, format = :hash)
    Parser#train(input = options[:training_data], truncate = true)

`#parse` parses the passed-in input (either a filename, your reference strings,
or an array of your reference strings; files are only opened if the string is
not tainted) and returns the parsed data in the
format specified as the second argument (supported formats include: *:hash*,
*:bibtex*, *:citeproc*, *:tags*, and *:raw*).

`#train` allows you to easily train the Parser's CRF model. The first argument
is either a filename (if the string is not tainted) or your data as a string;
the format of training data
follows the XML-like syntax of the
[CORA dataset](http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data/cora-ie.tar.gz); the
optional boolean argument lets you decide whether to train the existing
model or to create an entirely new one.

The following irb sessions illustrates some parser goodness:

    > require 'anystyle/parser'
    > Anystyle.parse 'Poe, Edgar A. Essays and Reviews. New York: Library of America, 1984.'
    => [{:author=>"Poe, Edgar A.", :title=>"Essays and Reviews", :location=>"New York", :publisher=>"Library of America", :year=>1984, :type=>:book}]
    > b = Anystyle.parse 'Dong C. Liu and Jorge Nocedal. 1989. On the limited memory BFGS method for large scale optimization. Mathematical Programming, 45:503–528.', :bibtex
    > b[0].author[1].given
    => "Jorge"
    > b[0].author.to_s
    => "Liu, Dong C. and Nocedal, Jorge"
    > puts Anystyle.parse('Auster, Paul. The Art of Hunger. Expanded. New York: Penguin, 1997.', :bibtex).to_s
    @book{auster1997a,
      author = {Auster, Paul},
      title = {The Art of Hunger},
      location = {New York},
      publisher = {Penguin},
      edition = {Expanded},
      year = {1997}
    }
    => nil

### Unhappy with the results?

Citation references come in many forms, so, inevitably, you will find data
where Anystyle-Parser does not produce satisfying parsing results.

    > Anystyle.parse 'John Lafferty, Andrew McCallum, and Fernando Pereira. 2001. Conditional random fields: probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 282-289. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, CA.'
    => [{:author=>"John Lafferty and Andrew McCallum and Fernando Pereira. 2001", :title=>"Conditional random fields: probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data", :booktitle=>"Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning", :pages=>"282--289", :publisher=>"Morgan Kaufmann", :location=>"San Francisco, CA", :type=>:inproceedings}]

This result is not bad, but notice how the year was not picked up as a date
but interpreted as part of the author name. If you have such a problem
(particularly, if the problem applies to a range of your input data, e.g.,
data that follows a style that Anystyle-Parser was not trained to recognize),
you can teach Anystyle-Parser to recognize your format. The easiest way to
go about this is to create new file (e.g., 'training.txt'), copy and paste a
few references, and tag them for training. For example, a tagged version of
the input from the example above would look like this:

    <author> John Lafferty, Andrew McCallum, and Fernando Pereira. </author> <date> 2001. </date> <title> Conditional random fields: probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data. </title> <booktitle> In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, </booktitle> <pages> pages 282–289. </pages> <publisher> Morgan Kaufmann, </publisher> <location> San Francisco, CA. </location>

Note that you can pick any tag names, but when working with Anystyle's model
you should use the same names used to to train the model. You can always ask
the Parser's model what names (labels) it knows about:

    > Anystyle.parser.model.labels
    => ["author", "booktitle", "container", "date", "doi", "edition", "editor", "institution", "isbn", "journal", "location", "note", "pages", "publisher", "retrieved", "tech", "title", "translator", "unknown", "url", "volume"]

Once you have tagged a few references that you want Anystyle-Parser to learn,
you can train the model as follows:

    > Anystyle.parser.train 'training.txt', false

By passing `true` as the second argument, you will discard Anystyle's default
model; the resulting model will be based entirely on your own data. By default
the new or altered model will not be saved, but you can do so at any time
by calling `Anystyle.parser.model.save` to save the model to the default file.
If you want to save the model to a different file, set the
`Anystyle.parser.model.path` attribute accordingly.

After teaching Anystyle-Parser with the tagged references, try to parse your
data again:

    > Anystyle.parse 'John Lafferty, Andrew McCallum, and Fernando Pereira. 2001. Conditional random fields: probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 282-289. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, CA.'
    => [{:author=>"John Lafferty and Andrew McCallum and Fernando Pereira", :title=>"Conditional random fields: probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data", :booktitle=>"Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning", :pages=>"282--289", :publisher=>"Morgan Kaufmann", :location=>"San Francisco, CA", :year=>2001, :type=>:inproceedings}]
