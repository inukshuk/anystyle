text          | Seismic building codes are intended to provide acceptable life safety to occupants and
              | protection against collapse during significant earthquake loading. Though structures
              | designed according to recent building codes have demonstrated adequacy in achieving
              | this goal, they can be vulnerable to extensive damage when subjected to even moderate
              | earthquakes. This damage leads not only to large economic costs, but can also result in
              | the loss of building functionality and occupant displacement. While seismic damage to
              | buildings can be mitigated by enhancing the strength and stiffness of the lateral-force
              | resisting system, this approach can be prohibitively costly for many structural systems.
              | Wood and cold-formed steel framed shear wall buildings present opportunities for
              | implementing a strength- and stiffness-enhanced seismic resisting system because these
              | structures are relatively light, often include floor plans with plentiful wall areas, and are
              | sensitive to damage at small levels of deformation. These structures also generally have
              | short periods of vibration, making them more sensitive to inelastic deformations than
              | larger, more flexible structures. Strength and stiffness enhancements to light frame
              | structures and components often lead to a limited-ductility response. As a result,
              | structures with strength and stiffness enhancements must not only be able to limit seismic
              | damage under the design earthquake, but also provide adequate life safety during larger
              | seismic events.

text          | In light-frame construction, architectural finishes including gypsum wallboard partitions
              | and stucco cladding can be particularly effective in increasing resistance to seismic loads
              | if they are strengthened, stiffened, and integrated into the structural system. These
              | enhancements can be achieved through the use of improved dowel-type fasteners and

              | to quantify the behavior of enhanced gypsum- and stucco-to-framing connections as well
              | as edge connections between gypsum panels. Light-frame walls built with these
              | enhancements of varying geometries were also tested. For gypsum-sheathed walls, it was
              | found that utilizing adhesive in addition to screws to attach sheathing to framing
              | increased wall strength by about two times and initial wall stiffness by about three times
              | when compared to conventional gypsum wallboard sheathed walls constructed with
              | screws alone. The use of large screw fasteners to attach stucco to framing was also found
              | to substantially increase connection and wall racking strength when compared to stucco
              | connected with conventional furring nails or staples. As with architectural walls without
              | enhancements, damage to strength- and stiffness-enhanced stucco and gypsum walls
              | initiated at drifts as small of 0.2%. Numerical finite element models were developed,
              | using the results from component and wall tests for calibration and validation. High
              | fidelity wall models explicitly represent each sheathing-to-framing fastener, anchorage,
              | and sheathing panel boundary while equivalent diagonal models use phenomenological
              | hysteretic springs to represent wall segment behavior. These new models allow for the
              | analysis of enhanced walls of varying geometries and boundary conditions as well as the
              | representation of complete building systems.
blank         | 
text          | The results from the experimentation and finite element models informed a new design
              | methodology for strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures that enforces a
              | drift limit of 0.2% under the design level earthquake to minimize drift-sensitive damage.
              | Two design approaches are described: a conventional equivalent lateral load approach
              | using a small response modification factor (R = 1.0), and a modal analysis design
              | method. For most building configurations, the modal design method can be performed
              | using equations and tables, without requiring intensive calculations.
blank         | 
text          | For near-fault locations, the strength and stiffness enhancements described may be
              | insufficient to avoid damaging deformations in light-frame structures subjected to the
              | design level earthquake. For buildings in these locations, an inexpensive sliding base

              | a parametric study.
blank         | 
text          | The performance of fixed-base and seismically isolated enhanced light-frame structures is
              | assessed and compared to that of conventional light-frame residential structures using
              | incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) and the building models developed. Both collapse
              | capacity and drift fragilities are investigated. These studies confirm that the simulated
              | enhanced light-frame structures provide adequate collapse safety while greatly reducing
              | the probability of incurring damaging seismic drifts when compared to conventional
              | light-frame structures. Seismic drifts in the isolated superstructures were found to be a
              | fraction of those required to initiate damage, with the critical variable in the performance
              | of these structures being the allowable sliding distance of the base isolation.

title         | Introduction
              | 1.1 Background
text          | While seismic building codes in the US generally provide adequate life safety for low-
              | rise residential structures, economic losses and disruption to functionality can be
              | substantial in cases of moderate and severe earthquakes. For example, the 1994
              | Northridge Earthquake produced $20 billion in estimated losses to light-frame structures
              | alone (Schierle 2002), representing about half of all losses (Kircher et al. 2006a).
              | Similarly, it is estimated that a repeat of the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake could
              | displace 160,000 to 250,000 households (Kircher et al. 2006b). One reason these
              | catastrophic consequences occur is that conventional light-frame building systems are
              | designed to allow large deformations during moderate and severe earthquakes; however
              | architectural components that are common in these structures, such as cladding and
              | partition walls, are vulnerable to damage at small drift levels. These damaged
              | components must be repaired or replaced, which can represent a significant financial
              | burden. Unlike larger steel and concrete buildings, gypsum board partitions, stucco, and
              | other finishes in light-frame buildings are directly attached to the structural system. This
              | means that they attract loads and are subjected to similar deformations as walls sheathed
              | with rated structural sheathing during seismic loading. While engineering practice over
              | the past decades has moved toward providing increased lateral structural ductility in
              | exchange for smaller strengths, this approach may not be effective for low-rise residential
              | construction where added strength is relatively inexpensive and even small deformations
              | can result in costly damage.

text          | Current structural systems for light-frame construction distinguish between structural
              | shear wall systems that utilize (a) engineered wood or steel sheathing and (b) other
              | sheathing materials. These other materials include gypsum board, stucco, and other finish
              | materials. The response modification factor (R-factor) for light-frame walls sheathed with
              | wood or steel sheathing given in ASCE 7 Minimum Design Loads for Building and other
              | Structures (ASCE 2010) is 6.5, while walls built with other sheathing materials are
              | assigned a coefficient of 2.0. This difference suggests less ductility and larger strength
              | demands for shear walls not utilizing rated sheathing panels. While light-frame walls may
              | be strengthened and stiffened to limit seismic deformations, these enhancements often
              | lead to walls with limited ductility, where wall strength is reached at small drifts and
              | resisted loads decrease substantially at larger deformations. Figure 1.1 conceptually
              | shows the difference in behavior of a lower strength ductile component and an enhanced-
              | strength limited-ductility component.

text          | While the limited-ductility system must have larger strength and therefore be able to
              | withstand larger forces than the ductile system when subjected to the same seismic
              | hazard, the resulting lateral displacements are much smaller than those incurred in a more
              | flexible structure. The building code favors increased ductility since, for many systems, it

              | reasons, building systems with high R-factors are widely perceived as having better
              | performance. However, the building code does not explicitly address damage control,
              | which is necessary to limit economic losses and ensure building functionality following
              | an earthquake. Some jurisdictions have recognized the benefit of strong and stiff limited-
              | ductility structural systems (NZNSEE 1986), but the use of these systems has been
              | limited to areas of low or moderate seismicity. Furthermore, very little research has been

text          | In the United States and Canada, the vast majority of residential structures are composed
              | of wood and cold-formed steel framed construction (Ellingwood et al. 2004). These
              | structures are generally light-weight and include floor plans with plentiful wall areas, and
              | are stiff with very small periods of vibration (Camelo 2003), often below 0.2 seconds.
              | Unlike larger steel and concrete buildings, the deformation response of short period
              | structures is very sensitive to the lateral strength. Figure 1.2 shows the displacement
              | modification factor, which is the ratio of peak inelastic deformations to the peak
              | deformations if the structure were to remain elastic, plotted for an array of periods and R-
              | factors (Ruiz‐García and Miranda 2003). For short period structures, lateral strength
              | strongly influences building drifts. Structures with large ductility demands under the
              | design earthquake (i.e. large R-factors and lower strengths), can experience inelastic
              | deformations several times higher than those that would be seen if the structure were to
              | remain elastic. Thus, large R-factors in short-period structures can lead to large inelastic
              | deformations and considerable damage.

text          | As increasing the lateral strength of short period structures can reduce lateral drift
              | demands, increasing the elastic stiffness can produce a similar benefit. The effect of
              | providing increased lateral strength and stiffness to light-frame low-rise structures can be
              | illustrated with a simple example. A single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system with
              | elastic perfectly-plastic hysteretic behavior is proposed. The initial stiffness and strength
              | are varied and the drift of the SDOF is calculated using the procedures outlined in FEMA
              | 440 (ATC 2005) to account for inelastic behavior and cyclic degradation. For the
              | maximum considered earthquake (MCE) design spectrum for a Seismic Design Category
              | (SDC) D site, the calculated inelastic spectral drifts and accelerations are shown in Figure
              | 1.3 over a range of structural periods representative of light-frame construction. As
              | expected, the system drift decreases dramatically with increases in strength and stiffness
              | (i.e., decreases in period). When the lateral system strength is only 20% of the SDOF
              | weight, the incurred drift is up to seven times larger than the equivalent system with
              | lateral strength equal to 100% of its weight (Cy = Vy/W = 1.0). This illustrates the
              | sensitivity of short period structures to lateral strength. When the system period is
              | increased from 0.1 to 0.2 seconds, representing a reduction in stiffness of 75%, the SDOF
              | drift increases by about 5 times for all lateral strength cases. Furthermore, since most
              | low-rise residential structures have periods that lie on the “plateau” of the design
              | acceleration response spectrum, increasing lateral stiffness does not increase the lateral
              | accelerations and forces that must be considered in design. The benefit of increasing
              | system stiffness is particularly beneficial if the period can be reduced to periods where

text          | Low-rise wood and cold-formed steel structures could greatly benefit from the utilization
              | of strength- and stiffness-enhanced limited-ductility seismic design concepts because
              | these structures have short periods, are sensitive to damage at small levels of lateral
              | deformation, and often are light and include a large number of walls that could be utilized
              | to significantly increase both the lateral strength and stiffness without substantially
              | increasing construction costs. While the underlying concept of “limited-ductility” runs
              | counter to conventional wisdom applied to the seismic design of larger structures, the aim
              | of this dissertation is to demonstrate that strength- and stiffness-enhanced design
              | concepts can simultaneously provide damage mitigation and collapse safety for light-

text          | While strength- and stiffness-enhanced systems can significantly reduce the seismic drifts

              | represents a strengthened and stiffened system with a period of 0.15 seconds and
              | normalized lateral yield strength of 1.0 g. Two maps of Southern California are shown in
              | Figure 1.4. Both maps illustrate the approximate regions where 0.2% drift would be
              | exceeded for the inelastic SDOF systems described subjected to a hypothetical Mw7.8
              | earthquake on the San Andreas Fault (Porter et al. 2011). The spectral accelerations for
              | these two structures were assumed to be the same and equal to the short period
              | accelerations predicted in the study. One map (Figure 1.4a) shows the area where the
              | SDOF would exceed 0.2% drift for the conventional structure and the second map
              | (Figure 1.4b) shows where this drift would be exceeded for the strengthened and stiffened
              | system. The area where a SDOF drift of 0.2% would be exceeded is much smaller for the
              | case where the strengthened and stiffened system is used as compared to the conventional
              | SDOF. In fact, using an enhanced system as opposed to a conventional system decreases
              | the area where the drift limit is exceeded by more than 80%. However, enhanced light-
              | frame systems in some near fault areas would still be vulnerable to damaging drifts. For
              | these areas, increased protection in the form of base isolation could be implemented to
              | avoid damaging deformations in the superstructure. The development of a low-cost base
              | isolation system to be used in combination with enhanced light-frame systems is also
              | explored in this thesis.

title         | 1.2 Objectives and scope
text          | The focus of this dissertation is to develop and validate design concepts for strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures in order to significantly improve their seismic
              | performance during earthquakes. Specific research objectives are as follows:
blank         | 
text          |       Develop a design concept for light-frame wood and cold-formed steel shear wall
              |        structures with enhanced strength and stiffness. This involves enhancing the
              |        strength and stiffness of conventional light-frame structures to tolerate larger
              |        loads with smaller levels of deformation. The goal of these concepts is to provide
              |        collapse safety under extreme ground motions (MCE) while eliminating damage
              |        during more common (design level) seismic events.
              |       Implement this design concept for light-frame construction by using conventional
              |        construction technologies. This can be accomplished by enhancing the
              |        contribution of architectural finish materials such as gypsum wallboard and stucco
              |        cladding to the lateral resistance by improving sheathing-to-framing connections
              |        and providing stronger and stiffer wall connections to adjacent members.
              |       Develop modeling approaches for enhanced light-frame systems. These should
              |        include models that can be used to determine the effect of component behavior
              |        (e.g., sheathing-to-framing fastener) on wall response, as well as less detailed
              |        models that can be used for capturing global behavior during repeated dynamic
              |        analysis and to aid in design. These models would use equivalent diagonal
              |        element to represent entire walls or wall segments.
              |       Formulate design methods for strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame
              |        systems that provide life safety while limiting structural drift demands under
              |        moderate to strong ground motions. Develop a reliable and practical method of
              |        analyzing and designing these structures.
              |       Explore the use of inexpensive sliding base isolation systems combined with
              |        enhanced light-frame systems for areas of very high seismicity (i.e., near fault
              |        locations). Identify the parameters of sliding base isolation systems that lead to
              |        improved performance of strength- and stiffness-enhanced systems.

text          | Since incorporating inexpensive finish materials into the lateral resisting system is the
              | desired means to enhance the strength and stiffness of light-frame structures, laboratory
              | testing and model development focused on gypsum board and stucco sheathed walls with
              | wood and cold-formed steel framing. The enhanced components tested included screw
              | and adhesive gypsum-to-framing fasteners, flat and corner gypsum panel joint
              | connections, and stucco-to-framing connections. More than one hundred fastener
              | component tests and seven small scale gypsum wallboard light-frame walls were tested.
              | Twenty additional full-sized enhanced wall and specimens, which were tested as part of a
              | companion project (Hopkins 2013; Hopkins et al. 2014), were reviewed and analyzed as
              | part of this study. The design procedure and performance-based evaluation are similarly
              | geared toward strength- and stiffness-enhanced structures where enhanced stucco and
              | gypsum walls provide all seismic resistance. Other enhanced wall systems may be used
              | for lateral strength- and stiffness-enhancement, but the properties of these systems must
              | first be quantified through laboratory testing. Since only a limited number of strength-
              | and stiffness enhanced light-frame walls could be tested, detailed finite element models
              | were used to determine the behavior of walls with varying wall aspect ratios, perforation
              | patterns, anchorage configurations, and end return details.

              | 2.1 Background
text          | Building codes have long recognized the economic advantage of designing ductile
              | structural components and systems. Providing ductility reduces the required lateral design
              | strength of the structure while providing structural safety through the ability to sustain
              | large drifts. According to current provisions, light-frame structures may be designed to be
              | flexible and much weaker than required to keep the building elastic under the design
              | earthquake (i.e., large R-factor). While this design methodology can provide collapse
              | safety as long as the lateral resisting elements are ductile, lateral deformation demands
              | will cause extensive damage in the event of even moderate earthquakes. If the
              | conventional system’s lateral strength and stiffness are increased, the force demands in
              | the structure will increase, but the lateral deformation demands may decrease
              | significantly, leading to damage reduction or elimination. Furthermore, since
              | strengthened and stiffened systems have smaller ductility demands than weaker and more
              | flexible structures, sufficient collapse protection can be provided with less ductility.
              | While ductility provides protection and warning to inhabitants during a seismic event, the
              | structure and architectural finishes may experience significant damage at drifts well
              | below those permitted for the design basis ground motion intensity. In many cases,
              | increasing the lateral strength may be helpful in reducing structural seismic deformations
              | and may be economically feasible.

text          | While the majority of research efforts in recent years have focused on providing
              | increased structural ductility, some investigators have recognized the benefit of strong
              | and stiff limited-ductility structural systems. Through a large series of time history

              | demand of buildings with long periods remained fairly constant with changes in lateral
              | strength. However, they noted that the ductility demand in short period structures was
              | very high and could be decreased significantly by increasing strength, reducing the
              | seismic response R-factor to about 1.5 or less. Watson (1989) noted that because of the
              | configuration or functional requirements of some structures, buildings may exhibit lateral
              | strength larger than the minimum amount required by design standards. He recommended
              | a design procedure specifically for concrete frames of with limited ductility.

text          | The concept of limited-ductility structures has also been explored by researchers in New
              | Zealand. In 1986, a report was produced to address several issues facing structures of
              | limited ductility in that country (NZNSEE 1986). The authors noted that for many
              | smaller structures, design may be carried out economically to accommodate larger
              | seismic loads than are required by the code. Buildings where the structural ductility
              | factor, defined as the maximum horizontal building displacement under strong ground
              | shaking divided by the yield displacement, is only between 2 and 3 would be classified as
              | having limited ductility. In these cases, the design seismic loads would be about 2.0 to
              | 2.5 times larger than those used if the ductility factor were in excess of 4. The authors
              | noted that while larger forces must be resisted with this limited-ductility approach,
              | capacity design would be unnecessary and ductility requirements for structural
              | components could be relaxed substantially.

title         | 2.2 Opportunities for innovation in light-frame
              |     structures
text          | The approach of providing a large amount of structural ductility and designing for
              | reduced seismic forces makes sense for large steel and concrete buildings where
              | providing additional strength can be expensive and impractical. In contrast, low-rise
              | wood and cold-formed steel framed residential structures typically have floor plans

text          | containing plentiful walls that are relatively strong and stiff relative to the mass of the
              | structure. Additionally, unlike flexible frame systems, light-frame walls and structures
              | often experience damage requiring repair at very small levels of deformation. For
              | example, gypsum wallboard partition walls start to experience cracking and bulging
              | around gypsum-to-framing dowel fasteners at story drifts as small as 0.2% (McMullin
              | and Merrick 2002; Arnold et al. 2003), even though these structures are often designed to
              | reach their peak strength at much larger drifts of 1-2%. For light-frame structures,
              | providing increased strength and stiffness can be relatively inexpensive by integrating
              | partitions and finishes that will be installed anyway into the seismic system. This
              | approach can greatly reduce repair costs and the risk of losing building habitability in the
              | case of a moderate to strong earthquake.
blank         | 
text          | Increased strength and stiffness can be provided to light-weight wood framed structures
              | at a nominal cost by adequately utilizing the architectural components in the lateral force-
              | resisting system. Currently, the lateral force resisting system in most low-rise light-frame
              | structures consists of shear walls with plywood, oriented strand board (OSB), or metal
              | sheathing designed using forces which are reduced from the elastic demands using a large
              | R-factor (typically 5 to 6.5). The partitions, cladding, ceilings, and other finishes are then
              | added; however, their strength contribution is typically either neglected or heavily
              | reduced in design calculations. This is likely done because walls sheathed with gypsum
              | wallboard and similar materials are allowed relatively low R-factors due to less ductile
              | performance.
blank         | 
text          | This current design methodology presents difficulty for light-frame structures since
              | codified R-factors are assigned assuming displacement demands are not sensitive to
              | lateral strength (i.e. the “equal displacement” notion). However, Ruiz‐García and
              | Miranda (2003) demonstrated that for short period buildings, such as light-frame
              | residential structures, inelastic deformations can be quite large when compared to elastic
              | deformation demands. This is especially true for cases with large response modification
              | factors (i.e., large R-values in U.S. seismic design standards). This suggests that
              | increasing design strength can significantly decrease inelastic drift demands for short-
              | period structures. Additionally, providing increased stiffness can decrease elastic

text          | displacement demands while not significantly changing strength demands. This occurs
              | because the design acceleration spectra are typically flat at short periods. In fact, the
              | design forces may even be reduced if sufficient lateral stiffness is provided to drive the
              | structural period into the ascending branch of the design response spectrum. These
              | concepts can be demonstrated by a simple analysis. A SDOF analysis was carried out
              | using a nonlinear hysteretic spring with a pinched shape similar to that expected for wood
              | and cold-formed steel walls (Folz and Filiatrault 2001). The hysteretic force-
              | displacement model is shown in Figure 2.1. The initial stiffness and yield strength of this
              | model were altered and a suite of twenty ground motion records scaled to the MCE level
              | for downtown Los Angeles were applied to measure the response of the SDOF. Figure
              | 2.2 shows the drift response (assuming a 2.4 m floor height). The stiffness is shows in
              | terms of weight of the SDOF divided by centimeters while the strength as shown as a
              | ratio of weight. When the strength and stiffness supplied to the system are small, the
              | drifts become quite large. As both the strength and stiffness increase, the peak drift
              | reduces considerably. When keeping lateral stiffness constant, systems with small lateral
              | strengths produced drifts well in excess of the elastic drift demands when strengths were
              | high.

text          | Increasing the lateral strength and stiffness in light-frame structures can be accomplished
              | economically by integrating finish materials into the lateral force resisting system and
              | enhancing the components of these finish wall assemblies. Gypsum sheathed walls can be
              | made stiffer by using enhanced dowel fasteners and by using adhesive to connect
              | sheathing to framing. Additionally, stronger and stiffer wall shear anchors and hold-
              | downs can be included in walls to increase wall racking strength and stiffness. While
              | exterior stucco cladding is often connected to the framing by relatively weak 25 mm (1
              | in) crown staples or furring nails, more substantial dowel fasteners may be used to
              | engage the stucco and provide enhanced strength. These enhanced fasteners provide a
              | better shear transfer between the framing and sheathing, similar to how shear studs

text          | the strength of the conventional gypsum board wall is much less than that of the wall
              | sheathed with structural plywood. The gypsum wall also shows considerable strength
              | deterioration after drifts of about 0.5%, while the plywood wall displays more ductile
              | behavior, continuing to resist large loads at 2% drift. For comparison, Figure 2.4a shows
              | the force-displacement behavior of a gypsum wallboard partition wall where an
              | inexpensive construction adhesive was used along with screws to fasten the gypsum to
              | framing (Acevedo et al. 2014). Figure 2.4b shows the behavior of a wall with enhanced
              | stucco (constructed with larger stucco-to-framing fasteners) on a gypsum substrate on
              | one side and adhesive-attached gypsum on the other. This data was obtained from a series
              | of tests performed as part of this project (Hopkins 2013). This figure shows that the
              | gypsum and stucco walls enhanced with larger dowel fasteners and adhesives reach
              | strengths near or exceeding that of the plywood sheathed conventional shear wall. Both
              | walls are also significantly stiffer at small levels of deformation than the conventional
              | gypsum or structural plywood-sheathed shear wall. Though these enhanced walls show
              | important reductions in strength after peak loading, lateral resistance similar to that of the
              | conventional walls is provided even at large wall drifts. Table 2.1 shows the strength and
              | stiffness of the conventional walls compared to the enhanced walls. This data
              | demonstrates that making simple, inexpensive enhancements to how sheathing and
              | finishes are attached to framing in conventional light-frame construction can lead to
              | significant gains in lateral strength and stiffness.

text          | MCE. To determine the amount of strength and stiffness required to mitigate damage in
              | low-rise light-frame structures, it is critical to identify the degree of structural
              | deformation that is acceptable and to determine if the strength and stiffness required to
              | limit these deformations could be realistically obtained given the layout of light-frame
              | structures and conventional construction methods.
blank         | 
text          | Several researchers have investigated the onset and progression of damage in walls and
              | finish materials common in light-frame structures. McMullin and Merrick (2007) tested a
              | series of walls sheathed with gypsum wallboard and noted that cracking at wall openings
              | and over gypsum-to-framing fasteners often occurred at drifts as small as 0.2%, with
              | local buckling of the wallboard occurring at drifts of about 0.5%. Arnold et al. (2003)
              | tested a series of stucco and gypsum wood-frame walls and studied the initiation and
              | progression of damage extensively. They noted that cracks around openings could be
              | observed at lateral drifts as small as 0.2%. Gypsum board cracking was noted around wall
              | perforations for gypsum-sheathed walls at drifts of 0.2%, with visible damage around
              | sheathing-to-framing dowel fasteners at 0.4% drift and cracks at gypsum panel
              | boundaries at 0.7% drift. Studying test data from conventional wood-frame wall tests
              | (CoLA-UCI 2001), Hart et al. (2012) estimated that the yield limit state (YLS), a point
              | where the third exceedance of a given racking displacement during a cyclic loading
              | procedure produces a force resistance at least 5% below the original force, occurred at
              | wall drifts less than 0.2% for all stucco walls studied, indicating performance-affecting
              | damage at this small level of deformation. Kircher et al. (2006a) developed building
              | damage functions and suggested that slight damage could be observed in wood structures
              | at story drifts of 0.3 to 0.4%, with moderate damage beginning at drifts of 0.5%.
blank         | 
text          | These studies indicate that even at very small levels of deformation, damage requiring
              | repair occurs in light-frame structural components and finishes. To mitigate seismic
              | damage in gypsum and stucco walls, story drift ratios should be limited to about 0.2% to
              | 0.3%. To obtain a rough estimate of the strength and stiffness required to avoid exceeding
              | this damage under the design level earthquake, an elastic lumped-mass SDOF system is
              | proposed. The elastic displacement of this system when subjected to the design level

text          | The required stiffness for a SDOF enhanced system is dependent of the mass tributary to
              | the roof and the story height. A study performed for the Environmental Protection
              | Agency (Frankilin Associates 1998) determined that the average demolition weight of
              | three small single-family residences, not including the weight of the concrete foundation,
              | was about 2.4 kN/m2 (50 psf). This number represents a typical unit weight for a house
              | with stucco cladding. The use of lightweight building façade materials would results in a
              | significantly smaller unit weight. The floor-to-floor height in many light-frame
              | residential structures is 2.4 to 3.0 m (8 to 10 feet). So, calculating the required stiffness
              | per square meter of house space for a representative one-story building with a floor
              | height of 2.7 meters, the required stiffness can be expressed according to Equation 2.4.

              | for use in stuctures with 5% equivalent viscous damping. The damping level in light-
              | frame structures has been shown to be highly variable and subject to the level of damage
              | incurred. Camelo (2003) suggested a damping of 7% to 10% of critical for seismic

text          | For rated plywood and oriented strand board (OSB) shear walls, the median ductility ratio
              | from testing has been determined as 4.8 (CoLA-UCI 2001). This procedure assumes that
              | the ultimate load capacity is the displacement at which the element resisting force is 80%
              | that of peak force. Miranda (1993) recommended an estimate of effective R-factor given

              | The prediction equation produced may be solved numerically for the required ductility

              | to remain almost elastic during the design earthquake while ensuring safety under the

text          | was used since this behavior is commonly observed in light-frame structures. Each
              | system was subjected to 40 ground motions scaled to the MCE level. The SDOF model
              | behavior and resulting median MCE drift with varying post-capping displacement values
              | can be seen in Figure 2.6. This figure shows that even with sharply-decreasing post-
              | capping stiffness (i.e. small post-capping displacement), large drifts can be avoided
              | during the MCE level ground shaking by providing a post-capping displacement that is at
              | least four times the yield displacement. Since the yield displacement corresponds to only
              | 0.2% drift, this required post-capping displacement represents less than 1% drift. While
              | appropriate post-capping ductility of enhanced light-frame systems must be ensured after
              | appropriate strength- and stiffness-enhanced elements have been developed, these
              | observations indicate that the required ductility demand it not especially large for these
              | systems to produce collapse safety during the MCE. This is largely due to the fact that

title         | 2.5 Summary
text          | Because wood and cold-formed steel framed structures are lightweight, have short
              | fundamental periods, and often include plentiful walls in their layouts, providing lateral
              | strength- and stiffness-enhancement is feasible and could greatly reduce drifts and
              | damage under moderate to strong earthquakes. Based on previous testing of structures
              | that included architectural finishes such as gypsum wallboard and stucco, it was observed
              | that damage requiring repair occurred at story drifts as small as 0.2% to 0.3%. The goal
              | of this research is to limit the deformations of light-frame residential structures to this
              | level during the design earthquake, while ensuring that sufficient ductility is provided
              | during the MCE event to prevent collapse. This is of particular concern since many
              | strength- and stiffness-enhanced walls reach peak strength at small drift levels and resist
              | significantly smaller forces at large deformations.
blank         | 
text          | In this section, strength, stiffness, and ductility targets were estimated based on simple
              | dynamics calculations and the properties of actual light-frame residential structures.
              | Using a simple SDOF model, it was determined that the strength- and stiffness-enhanced
              | structure would have to be designed to remain elastic during the design earthquake, with
              | lateral stiffness tuned to limit drifts to 0.2%. To provide sufficient collapse safety under
              | the MCE event, the post-capping displacement capacity must be three to four times the
              | approximate yield displacement of the system. Given that the peak strength may be
              | achieved at 0.2% drift, this ductility demand represents a reasonable post-capping drift
              | capacity of about 1.0%, though building collapse simulation is performed later in this
              | study to confirm this estimate.
blank         | 
text          | It is desirable to achieve strength and stiffness enhancement is light-frame structures
              | without requiring additional wall area in typical structures. A series of actual home floor
              | plans were inspected to estimate the amount of walls that would be available for
              | enhancement in a typical house layout. Based on the average length of walls included in
              | two-story houses and estimated masses, it was determined that enhanced walls must have
              | strengths of roughly 21 kN/m (1450 plf) and initial stiffnesses of 4 kN/mm/m in (7
              | kips/in/ft) order to limit story drifts to a tolerable level during the design earthquake.

text          | Though these demands are large compared to typical light-frame walls with rated
              | sheathing panels, increased wall strength and stiffness may be achieved economically by
              | making inexpensive enhancements to how sheathing and finishes are attached to framing

text          | The lateral resistance of strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures is
              | principally provided by shear walls. As part of the design approach for strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures, walls that have been previously considered to
              | be architectural will be utilized to resist considerable lateral forces. These include light-
              | frame walls sheathed in gypsum wallboard and stucco. To understand the performance of
              | conventional and enhanced light-frame walls and structures, the behavior of individual
              | components within the walls are investigated. These components include sheathing-to-

title         | 3.1 Screw and adhesive gypsum-to-framing connection
              |     tests
text          | One approach to reducing seismic damage in light-frame structures is to increase lateral
              | stiffness and strength. Since low-rise wood and cold-formed steel framed buildings often
              | contain many partition walls, this can be achieved economically by enhancing gypsum-
              | sheathed walls. This section describes a series of connection tests of enhanced screw and
              | adhesive connections between gypsum wallboard and either wood or cold-formed steel
              | framing members. Experimental results indicate that while enhanced screw fasteners can
              | increase connection and wall strength modestly over conventional drywall screws, more
              | significant strength and stiffness increases can be achieved with construction adhesives.
              | When conventional screw fasteners are used in conjunction with adhesives, the screws
              | continued to provide wall racking resistance in a manner similar to walls built with screw
              | fasteners alone after the adhesive fails. This suggests that the use of conventional screws
              | with adhesives can ensure adequate connection ductility after adhesive failure.

title         | 3.1.1 Background
blank         | 
text          | The behavior of wood and cold-formed steel walls is largely controlled by the behavior of
              | individual sheathing-to-framing fasteners. Several studies have been performed to
              | characterize the performance of individual fasteners between wood framing members and
              | sheathing-to-framing fasteners. Most of these studies have focused on the behavior of
              | fasteners in framing members alone or installed through wood sheathing. Sawata and
              | Yasumura (2002) studied the embedment strength of dowel fasteners in wood parallel
              | and perpendicular to the grain, finding that wood strength perpendicular to the grain was
              | significantly higher than parallel. Rosowsky and Reinhold (1999) tested various wood
              | nail and screw connections in withdrawal and shear, varying the rate of loading. Their
              | study showed that the strength of fasteners deformed at a rate of 1.3 m/s (50 in/s) or
              | larger sustained loads about twice as high as fasteners tested statically. McLain and
              | Carroll (1990) tested a series of threaded dowel fasteners loaded in a combination of
              | shear and withdrawal, demonstrating that threaded fasteners loaded with withdrawal
              | forces were stronger in shear than those loaded in shear alone. Girhammar et al. (2004)

text          | tested wood nail joints monotonically in hardboard, particleboard, and plywood, varying
              | the fastener panel edge distance and loading direction. Their results demonstrated that the
              | strength and ductility of nailed connections to wood sheathing increases with increased
              | panel edge distance. Goodall (2010) tested a series of conventional screws and nails in
              | gypsum-to-wood connections, demonstrating that strengths and failure modes changed as
              | the fastener gypsum edge distance was varied. Reduced strengths and breakage of the
              | gypsum along the panel edge was observed for fasteners with small edge distances. Some
              | research has also been performed on sheathing-to-wood connections using adhesives.
              | Rosowsky and Schiff (1999) tested common nail, screw, and polyurethane adhesive
              | connections to OSB and plywood, loading them in withdrawal and shear. They found that
              | the adhesive connections were often many times stronger than conventional screw and
              | nail connections. The predominant observed failure modes in the adhesive connections
              | were wood fiber tearing when loaded in withdrawal and breakage of the adhesive bond
              | when loaded in shear. Kurt (2003) tested wood-to-plywood connections joined using a
              | gap-filling phenol resorcinol formaldehyde (GPRF) adhesive. The results showed that the
              | connection could sustain average stresses of about 6 MPa (870 psi). Broughton and
              | Hutchison (2001) tested a series of epoxy, acrylic, polyurethane, and GPRF wood-to-
              | wood connections, noting that epoxies produced connection strengths that were on
              | average about twice that of the other tested adhesives.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Research has also been carried out to characterize the performance of sheathing-to-
              | framing connections in cold-formed steel. Lennon et al. (1999) tested three types of
              | screw and rivet fasteners in 1 mm thick steel-to-steel connections. They noted that self-
              | tapping screw connections showed low initial stiffness, but high ductility due to dragging
              | of the screw through the framing member at large displacements. Connection strength
              | and initial stiffness were greatly enhanced by utilizing thicker (2 mm) cold-formed steel
              | members. Innovative dowel fasteners have also been developed for cold-formed steel
              | construction including the use of rivets and press-joints (Di Lorenzo and Landolfo 2004).
              | These connections are often many times stronger and stiffer than conventional screw
              | fastener connections for steel-to-steel joints. Miller and Pekoz (1994) tested a series of
              | gypsum-to-steel connections, varying the gypsum board thickness, fastener edge distance,
meta          | CHAPTER 3. ENHANCED GYPSUM AND STUCCO COMPONENT TESTS                                  31

text          | and location of the tapered gypsum edge. They noted that increasing the thickness of the
              | gypsum increased strength. Increasing the edge distance not only increased fastener
              | strength, but changed the failure mechanism from tearing of the gypsum edge to shearing
              | of the drywall screws. A large series of screw connection experiments for cold-formed
              | steel framing were carried out using both gypsum wallboard and OSB sheathing (Fiorino
              | et al. 2007). These tests showed that the strength and energy dissipated were larger when
              | using OSB sheathing, but gypsum wallboard connections were initially stiffer and
              | ultimately more ductile. Toma et al. (1993) noted that adhesive connections in cold-
              | formed steel could be composed of epoxy or more flexible acrylic adhesives and that
              | adhesive connections can provide large resistances in shear, but often have low peeling
              | strengths.

text          | While many wood and cold-formed steel connection tests have been performed, few have
              | included gypsum sheathing or explored the effect of reverse cyclic loading. In order to
              | more fully understand the behavior of wood and cold-formed steel walls sheathed with
              | gypsum using different dowel and adhesive connections, gypsum-to-framing connection
              | tests were performed as part of this research. Additionally, data from individual fastener
              | experiments was later used to calibrate finite element wall models that could predict the
              | behavior of gypsum sheathed walls of differing geometries by modeling the behavior of
              | discreet fasteners within wall specimens (Chapter 5). This section describes a set of
              | experiments that were performed to determine the behavior of different enhanced screw
              | and adhesive connections used to attach both wood and cold-formed steel framing to
              | gypsum wallboard. Connections were tested under monotonic and cyclic loading
              | protocols to capture hysteretic behavior and strength and stiffness degradation. The onset
              | and progression of damage in these connections were also investigated.

              | studs (stud grade Douglas fir) or 20 gauge cold-formed steel framing. The thicker Type X
              | gypsum was selected as it provides a larger bearing area against nail and screw fasteners.

text          | In addition to drywall screws, three separate types of adhesive were investigated as
              | summarized in Table 3.1. Adhesive 1 is a powdered gypsum joint compound (Westpac
              | 2012) hydrated with water and a concrete bonding adhesive (Quikrete 2014) for added
              | strength. Adhesive 2 (ICI Paints 2006) and Adhesive 3 (Henkel 2011) are inexpensive
              | (about $2 for a 280 gram or 10 oz. tube) pre-packaged readily available construction
              | adhesives. These adhesives were tested with both wood and cold-formed steel framing
              | using 15.9 mm Type X gypsum wallboard.

text          | The fastener test configuration is shown in Figure 3.2, where the active fastener
              | connection is between the vertical center stud and the wallboard panel. The panels
              | measured 851 mm (24 in) by 914 mm (36 in) and were framed on all four edges, leaving
              | a gap on the top edge for installation of the active test stud. When adhesive was used, an
              | adhesive bead of 10 mm (3/8 in) in diameter, which flattened to cover the entire stud
              | width (38 mm), was applied to the contacting surface of the test stud before the gypsum
              | wallboard was applied. The edge framing was attached with 41 mm drywall screws at 76
              | mm (3 in) on center to ensure failure occurred along the center stud. When screw
              | fasteners were tested, the heads of the fasteners were mudded, sanded, and painted in
              | order to observe and monitor damage occurrence and progression during testing.

title         | Test Setup and Procedure
blank         | 
text          | All specimens were tested in a 250 kN (55 kip) MTS 322 Test Frame controlled using
              | MTS MultiPurpose TestWare. Wood screws were used to attach the vertical edge studs to
              | steel channels that were bolted to the testing machine base. Using large wood screws, the
              | center stud was connected to a steel loading yoke, which was attached to the loading
              | piston. For tests with cold-formed steel framing, wood inserts (measuring 51 mm by 102
              | mm) were shaped to fit inside the loading and end studs to ensure a strong screwed
              | connection to the yoke and end channels.

text          | A pair of potentiometric displacement transducers was attached to each face of the panel
              | to measure relative displacement between the gypsum wallboard and the center test stud.
              | The reported displacements are calculated as the mean of the relative displacements
              | measured from the four transducers. Specimens were tested using either a pseudo-static
              | monotonic protocol or the CUREE-Caltech cyclic protocol for woodframe components
              | (Krawinkler et al. 2001). This protocol is referred to as Test Method C in ASTM
              | Standard E2126 (2011). As shown in Figure 3.3. the displacement amplitude for cyclic
              | loading ranges from 0.5 to 50 mm, where the leading cycle of each displacement step is
              | followed by two cycles with displacement amplitudes of 75% that of the leading cycle.
              | Small displacement amplitude steps (less than 2.0 mm) include six to seven cycles per
              | step, while only three to four cycles are used at larger displacement amplitudes (larger
              | than 2.0 mm).

text          | Representative force-displacement plots for screw and adhesive-enhanced screw fastener
              | connections in wood framing are shown in Figure 3.4. Since the adhesive connection was
              | much stronger and stiffer than the screw fastener connection alone, the two plot axes do
              | not have the same limits. The adhesive-enhanced connection reached a strength and
              | initial stiffness more than five times larger than that of the drywall screw alone. The
              | adhesive connection reached its strength at about 0.5 mm of deformation, while the screw
              | fastener reached its strength at about 10 mm of deformation (relative deformation
              | between the wood stud and the gypsum wallboard sheathing). The initial stiffness of the
              | adhesive connection was very linear, whereas the screw fastener alone showed a highly
              | nonlinear force-displacement envelope, even at small levels of deformation.

text          | The strength and initial stiffness of all gypsum fasteners tested are summarized in Table
              | 3.2. The stiffness indicated in this table as K0 is the secant stiffness measured at ±0.16 kN
              | (35 lbs) per fastener while the strength value Fu is the peak strength per fastener reached
              | in either loading direction. The secant stiffness was measured at this force level because
              | it represents about a third of the strength capacity of typical drywall screws and the
              | stiffness measured at this point is not significantly degraded from its initial condition.
              | Cyclic envelope curves were determined by enveloping the peaks of the cyclic hysteretic

              | connections in cold-formed steel allow for rigid fastener rotation about the thickness of

text          | The cyclic envelope curves show similar trends as the monotonic curves, except that
              | force values are slightly reduced as a result of cyclic degradation. For example, the screw
              | fasteners in wood framing showed average strengths 15% lower under cyclic loading, as
              | compared to monotonic loading. The adhesive connections showed less reduction in
              | strength under cyclic loading. The cyclic data shows that the enhanced screws were more
              | than 15% stronger than either of the other screw fasteners in wood. The fine threaded,
              | coarse threaded, and enhanced screws in wood began losing strength at displacements of
              | about 5 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, respectively, whereas the fine threaded screw fastener
              | in steel framing maintained about 85% of its strength at relative displacements of 20 mm.
              | This difference was mostly due to the mode of failure. The screw fasteners in wood failed
              | by either crushing of the gypsum or fracture of the screw, whereas the screws in steel
              | failed by rotation of the screw through the thin steel flange or elongation of the fastener
              | hole in the steel. The three types of screw fastener connections in wood displayed similar
              | secant stiffnesses at cyclic displacement peaks of all magnitudes. However, the stiffness
              | of the fine threaded fasteners in steel framing was about half that of fasteners tested in
              | wood. This difference is again due to the mechanisms of fastener deformation in wood
              | and steel framing. Whereas wood framing inhibits rigid body rotation of screws, the thin
              | gauge of the steel framing allows for rotation about the insertion point.

text          | One of the goals of enhancing the strength and stiffness of gypsum-sheathed walls is to
              | reduce the observed damage to light-frame structural components. Figure 3.7 shows the
              | appearance of screw fasteners at three levels of relative displacement between the
              | framing studs and the gypsum wallboard. First visible screw fastener damage began at
              | gypsum-to-framing displacements of about 1 mm, where very small grooves appeared
              | around the fastener heads. When screw fastener displacements reached about 3 mm, the
              | cracks had widened and a gap between the fastener and the wallboard formed. As
              | displacements increased, this gap widened. At very large displacements, some screw
              | fasteners fractured, while others bent and were pulled below the paper surface of the
              | gypsum wallboard (Figure 3.7c). Screw fractures always occurred in the threaded shank,
              | typically 2 or 3 mm into the wood where the screws are subjected to larger flexural
              | strains. Differences in screw fastener type, framing material, and the presence of adhesive
              | did not noticeably alter the pattern of damage progression or the fastener displacement at
              | which damage levels were reached. When the thicker 15.9 mm gypsum board was used,
              | the fasteners were more likely to bend and fracture during loading, as compared to the
              | thinner 12.7 mm wallboard material. Conventional drywall screws fractured more often

              | of green tagged buildings. However, in the ensuing months hundreds of thousands of

text          | strength about 25% higher than the adhesive connections alone. The adhesive
              | connections to steel framing were less stiff than those to wood framing. Most notably, the
              | case with adhesive only on steel was substantially more flexible than the other adhesive
              | connections for displacements exceeding about 0.1 mm. For both types of framing, the
              | combination of adhesive plus screw fasteners increased the peak strength by more than
              | three times and initial stiffness by more than five times as compared to screws alone. The
              | initial loading stiffness of the adhesive connections is also much more linear than that of
              | screw fasteners alone, such that the peak strengths are reached at less than 1 mm of
              | displacement.
blank         | 
text          | Under cyclic loading, all adhesive connections were at least three times stronger and
              | four times stiffer than screw fasteners alone, indicating that using adhesives is an
              | economical way of significantly increasing the strength and stiffness of framing-to-
              | sheathing connections. For connections to wood framing, the Adhesive 2 connection was
              | about 10% stronger than Adhesive 1. When screws were used with Adhesive 2, the
              | strength increased by more than 20%, as compared to the adhesive alone. When using
              | cold-formed steel framing, Adhesive 1 and Adhesive 2 reached similar strengths. The test
              | with Adhesive 2 and screws was 60% stronger than the adhesive alone. This strength of
              | adhesive connections with screws exceeds the strength of the screw and adhesive
              | connections combined, suggesting that pressure provided by the screws could provide
              | enhanced adhesive bonding and delay the full failure of the bonding within the gypsum
              | wallboard. For all adhesive connections, the stiffness degraded only slightly before peak
              | loading. This is remarkable when compared to screw fasteners, where stiffness degrades
              | even at very small displacement loading cycles. For example, at half the ultimate strength
              | of the tested screws, the tangent stiffness was about 15% to 40% of the initial stiffness. In
              | contrast, the tangent stiffness of the adhesive connections at half of ultimate strength was
              | at least 60% of the initial tangent stiffness. For both wood and cold-formed steel framing,
              | Adhesive 1 was somewhat stiffer than Adhesive 2, which is consistent with observations
              | that Adhesive 2 was somewhat softer than Adhesive 1 after curing. In general, the
              | adhesive connections to steel framing were about half as stiff as comparable connections
              | to wood framing.

text          | Damage to adhesive connections after testing can be seen in Figure 3.10, which shows
              | the center test stud after the gypsum was removed. Figure 3.10a shows failure through the
              | paper backing of the gypsum wallboard for a wood framed connection, where the
              | adhesive developed the strength of the paper and even removed some gypsum. This type
              | of failure was the most common with wood framing, indicating that failure did not occur
              | within the adhesive but rather within the paper-gypsum interface. The implication of this
              | is that using stronger adhesives (e.g., epoxy-based adhesives) would not lead to stronger
              | connections as the failure is not controlled by the adhesive itself. Figure 3.10b shows a
              | wood framed specimen in which the combination of screw and adhesive connections
              | developed the strength of the entire thickness of gypsum board leading to failure within

              | %age of the contact area), failure occurred in the adhesive layer and not in the wallboard.
              | This failure mechanism was more common in cold-formed steel specimens where the

title         | 3.1.4 Effect of screw fastener edge distance
blank         | 
text          | In the tests described previously, the fasteners were located at the center of a gypsum
              | panel, more than 400 mm (16 in) from the edge of gypsum wallboard panel. In light-
              | frame shear walls, many drywall screw fasteners are often placed at the edge of sheathing
              | panels. Since typical framed studs are less than 40 mm (1.5 in) wide, fastener edge
              | distance is often very small, especially in locations where several pieces of sheathing
              | meet over a single stud. To investigate the effect of panel edge distance on screw fastener
              | behavior, a number of screw tests were conducted where the gypsum sheathing was
              | discontinuous over the test stud. As shown in Figure 3.11, the test setup is similar to that
              | used in the previous fastener tests, except that it includes a seam in the gypsum wallboard
              | along the center loading stud. In these experiments, a 3 mm (1/8 in) gap was left between
              | the adjacent pieces of sheathing, and the edge fasteners were installed at a distance of 25
              | mm, 19 mm, or 16 mm from the edge of the gypsum sheathing. When larger edge
              | distances were used, the width of the test stud was increased to ensure proper screw
              | embedment in the framing. After the screw fasteners were installed, a pre-mixed
              | compound was applied over the fasteners and the surface was painted prior to testing.
              | Douglas fir framing and 15.9 mm Type X gypsum wallboard were used for all edge
              | fastener tests. All fastener edge specimens were tested with the CUREE-Caltech loading
              | protocol (Figure 3.3). Both enhanced screw fasteners and 41 mm coarse threaded screws
              | were studied, though the coarse threaded screws were only tested with an edge spacing of
              | 16 mm.

text          | When testing the edge-connected fasteners, the force-displacement behavior was
              | observed to be unsymmetrical (see Figure 3.12). This occurred because as the center stud
              | was pushed down, the gap between the pieces of gypsum sheathing tended to close and
              | the fasteners were forced to deform by crushing through the gypsum wallboard. When the
              | center stud was pulled upward, the gap between the gypsum pieces opened and the
              | fasteners broke through the small edge distance of the gypsum sheathing with less
              | resistance. The deformation of the edge fastener test panels during upward and downward
              | center stud loading is illustrated in Figure 3.13. These deformations are caused by
              | bending deformation in the panel as the bottom side of the specimens were not
              | continuously supported, but only attached at the two ends.

title         | 3.1.5 Adhesive bonding to cold-formed steel framing
blank         | 
text          | Testing of adhesive connections to cold-formed steel framing members revealed that the
              | strength of these connections was significantly smaller than that of the adhesive
              | connections with wood. By de-constructing the adhesive cold-formed steel fastener panel
              | specimens, it was noted that in several instances, the adhesive itself failed across
              | approximately 20% to 35% of the contact area and that the strength of the paper backing
              | of the gypsum was not fully developed. This failure mechanism contrasts with that of
              | adhesive-to-wood connections, where the strength of the gypsum paper backing was
              | developed. This premature failure in cold-formed steel connections likely occurred
              | because the pre-mixed adhesive (Adhesive 2) did not adhere as well to steel as it did to
              | the wood framing. To determine whether another adhesive would provide an improved
              | bond to steel, seven inexpensive pre-mixed construction adhesives were tested on cold-
              | formed steel framed studs. The names of the construction adhesives are shown in Table
              | 3.4. Adhesive 2 was tested again during this program. The adhesive numbers for this
              | study correspond to those tested in the larger gypsum panels to avoid confusion. Each of
              | the tested adhesives were inexpensive construction adhesives, ranging in cost from less
              | than $2 to about $7 per 280 gram (10 oz.) tube. Small specimens were constructed out of
              | steel framing and measured approximately 150 mm by 150 mm by 100 mm in thickness
              | (6 in x 6 in x 4 in). One piece of gypsum was attached to a small test stud using the test
              | adhesive and no additional fasteners. A bottom track was attached with adhesive and
              | screws to assure failure occurred in the test stud. The test stud protruded from the top of
              | the gypsum by 25 mm. Each specimen was placed under a vertical actuator and loaded
              | monotonically until the connection failed. A representative test specimen is shown in
              | Figure 3.17. The forces and stiffnesses shown correspond to an equivalent fastener
              | spacing of 178 mm (7 in) to allow comparison to screw connections. This means that the
              | force and stiffness per fastener shown correspond to an adhesive contact area of 35 mm
              | by 178 mm, or 6200 mm2 (9.6 in2).

text          | A series of gypsum-to-framing screw and adhesive connections were subjected to
              | monotonic and cyclic loading with both wood and cold-formed steel framing. These tests
              | provide fundamental understanding of adhesive connection behavior as well as data to
              | calibrate finite element wall models. Figure 3.20 shows the normalized strength and
              | stiffness of gypsum-to-framing screw and adhesive connections tested cyclically. The
              | responses shown have been normalized by the strength and stiffness of conventional 41
              | mm drywall screws. The enhanced screw fasteners for wood framing were about 20%

              | enhanced screw fasteners for wood were modestly stronger than conventional drywall
              | screws, the adhesive dramatically increased connection strength and stiffness. Standard
              | construction adhesives increased the strength and stiffness of connections to wood
              | framing by more than five times. While the bond was sufficiently strong to force failure
              | into the gypsum wallboard itself, failure typically occurred within the thickness of the
              | paper or the gypsum-paper interface. The adhesive also increased the fastener strength
              | and stiffness with cold-formed steel studs considerably, with strength and stiffness four
              | and seven times larger, respectively, than the screw connections alone. With steel
              | framing, failure was observed at the adhesive-to-stud interface, suggesting that adhesives
              | with stronger metal adhesion could further increase the strength and stiffness for steel-
              | framed systems. In all cases, connections with adhesive remained essentially elastic until
              | approaching the peak strength, whereas connections using only drywall screws or even
              | with enhanced drywall screws only displayed significant stiffness degradation at small
              | displacements.

title         | 3.2 Gypsum panel joint tests
text          | The edges of gypsum wallboard panels are often connected to the boundaries of
              | perpendicular adjacent panels with joint tape and wet spackling compound. While these
              | joints are primarily finished for aesthetic reasons, the gypsum joint finishes can transmit
              | significant loads across panel boundaries to adjacent panels. Thus, the joints can
              | contribute to the strength and stiffness in gypsum sheathed walls. The goal of joint testing
              | is to characterize the behavior of these finished gypsum joints when different joint
              | conditions (e.g., framing details, blocking, etc.) are utilized. The behavior of these
              | gypsum joints can be implemented in finite element wall models to understand the
              | transfer of forces across these boundaries. Enhanced corner connections can result not
              | only in less damage, but at the same time increase the participation of walls loaded out-
              | of-plane on the lateral stiffness and strength of adjacent walls loaded in-plane. This
              | section describes tests conducted to investigate the strength of conventional and enhanced
              | gypsum panel tape connections.

text          | Researchers have recognized the benefit of joint taping in improving the performance of
              | gypsum walls. In a series of braced gypsum wall tests, Wolfe (1983) noted that none of
              | the walls tested experienced cracking at the wallboard boundary when joints were taped
              | and spackled. McMullin and Merrick (2002) also tested gypsum framed walls with taped

text          | panel joints. In a survey to contractors, they found that contractors used paper joint tape
              | and all-purpose joint compound, though some used fiberglass tape and a ready-mix or
              | fast drying compound. While not the primary mode of failure in their tests, breakage of
              | the gypsum joint was a common mode of failure observed. The same authors recorded
              | the onset of joint damage in gypsum wallboard wood framed walls without blocking
              | (McMullin and Merrick 2007). They noted that on average, a vertical crack between
              | adjacent partition walls occurred at a drift level of 0.7%, while horizontal cracks between
              | panels occurred at an average drift of 1.7%. They also noted that the mode of failure of
              | the gypsum-to-framing fastener connection affected the behavior of gypsum joint
              | connections. When screw fasteners failed in punching shear through the thickness of the
              | gypsum, the joints often remained intact and all gypsum panels rotated together as drifts
              | increased. When the screw fasteners were stronger, joint cracking was more widespread
              | and the panels deformed independently.
blank         | 
text          | While several investigators have previously noted the role of gypsum joint tape and
              | compound in gypsum partition wall racking behavior, very little information is available
              | regarding the behavior of the joints themselves. Understanding the behavior of these
              | connections is critical in ensuring that gypsum joints do not become the critical weakness
              | in the gypsum partition walls. It is also important to understand the contribution to
              | strength and stiffness as well as the performance of such joints to accurately represent
              | them in the finite element modeling of light-frame walls. Because the mechanisms that
              | govern the behavior of flat and corner gypsum-to-gypsum panel connections are
              | different, both geometries were tested.

text          | A series of experiments were performed to quantify the behavior of gypsum panel joints
              | at corners. These joints are representative of joints between orthogonal walls and between
              | walls and ceilings. A drawing of a corner gypsum joint test specimen is shown in Figure
              | 3.21. The specimens were built by connecting a 38 mm x 286 mm (2 in x 12 in nominal)
              | board to a 38 mm x 89 mm (2 in x 4 in nominal) stud on each side. Each stud was
              | connected to the larger board by two 10d box nails. Narrow gypsum wallboard panels

text          | were attached to the face of each board and stud with multiple screws along the panel
              | face. At joint intersections, the panels were fit snugly and joint tape and compound were
              | applied. Five specimens were built to represent conventional gypsum joints and five
              | additional specimens were built with enhanced joints. The conventional joints utilized
              | 12.7 mm (1/2 in) gypsum wallboard and a 48 mm (1-7/8 in) paper joint tape (Figure
              | 3.22). This tape was applied using a pre-mixed all-purpose gypsum compound. The
              | compound was first applied underneath the tape, the tape was set, and then another coat
              | was placed over the tape and allowed to set. After joint curing, the compound was lightly
              | sanded and another layer of compound applied. The joints were then again lightly sanded
              | and then painted with a flat white paint. The five enhanced joint specimens were built
              | with 15.9 mm (5/8 in) Type X gypsum wallboard. Construction was similar except the
              | joints were constructed with a 76 mm (3 in) fiberglass joint tape (Figure 3.22) and an
              | enhanced compound. The enhanced compound was composed of a powdered quick-
              | setting compound hydrated with a mixture that was one part concrete bonding adhesive to
              | three parts water. The bonding adhesive created a compound that was very strong and
              | tough when cured. The liquid was added to the power and mixed until a smooth, buttery
              | consistency was achieved. All corner gypsum specimens were built with stud grade or
              | better Douglas fir lumber. Since two nails in addition to joint tape and compound crossed
              | each framing member boundary, tests without joint compound were performed to
              | determine the contribution of these nails to joint strength and stiffness.

              | and Series 2 tests can be seen in Figure 3.25. These two series of tests were meant to
              | simulate the behavior of joints in pure shear with minimal flexure occurring across the
              | joints. These panels were composed of three separate pieces framed in 38 mm x 89 mm

              | and 4.0 kN/m (270 lbs/ft) under monotonic and cyclic testing, respectively. The strength
              | of the enhanced joint was 5.0 kN/m (340 lbs/ft) and 4.3 kN/m (290 lbs/ft) for monotonic
              | and cyclic testing, respectively. The cyclic data from the gypsum corner edge connection
              | tests show that while on average the enhanced joint reached somewhat larger strengths

text          | The similar strength and stiffness observed in gypsum corner joints with different joint
              | tapes and compound could have occurred for a few reasons. First, when the gypsum
              | panels were attached, the panels were fit snug to each other before the joint compound
              | was applied. This means that there was virtually no penetration of the joint compound
              | within the thickness of the wallboard panels in the joint. The compound and tape was
              | only effective at providing bonding between the panels at the very surface of the boards.
              | Secondly, after the initial cracking of the joint, the joint tape did very little to resist
              | deformations along the joint. This was the case for both types of joint tapes because after
              | loosening of the compound, the tape becomes slack and fails to resist further loads. This
              | does not occur in flat joints where the tape remains taut after initial joint cracking. An
              | illustration of this phenomenon is shown in Figure 3.30. For these reasons, the strength
              | and stiffness of the conventional and enhanced corner panel joining methods were
              | comparable and the described enhanced joint compound would not be recommended to
              | improve the performance of gypsum-to-gypsum corner joints.

text          | Figure 3.31 shows the initiation and progression of corner joint damage when
              | conventional tape and joint compound were used. In general, there was virtually no
              | visible damage to the joint until the ultimate joint strength was reached, which occurred
              | at joint displacements of around 1.0 mm or less for all specimens tested. At this level of
              | deformation, a small crack formed along the interface between the two gypsum panels
              | (Figure 3.31a). As shear deformations along the joint increased, the joint paper tore and
              | the crack between the panels became more visible (Figure 3.31b). At very large
              | displacements, the joint pulled apart and a wide break between the gypsum panels often
              | appeared (Figure 3.31c). Observable onset and progression of damage in the enhanced
              | joints was similar and can be seen in Figure 3.32. One difference in the behavior of the
              | two joint types is that at larger displacements, the enhanced fiberglass joint tape did not
              | tear (Figure 3.32c). However, since the tape became slack after the surrounding joint
              | compound broke up, this intact tape provided virtually no shear resistance at the corner.

              | existing in light-frame walls where tensile and compressive forces exist along the joint

              | only one joint broke completely at the end of testing. When this occurred, forces were

              | the conventional joint with blocking was 73% stronger than the joint without blocking
              | and just 8% weaker than the enhanced joint without blocking. This is remarkable
              | considering the pure shear tests only showed a modest increase in strength when blocking
              | was added. In all tested specimens, the blocking was effective in resisting flexure across
              | the joint and reducing the tension applied to the joint tape and compound. As with the
              | Series 1 and 2 tests, the addition of blocking created a more ductile joint. At a joint
              | displacement of 10 mm, the monotonically loaded conventional joint resisted 94% of its
              | ultimate load, while both joints tested without blocking resisted only 67% their ultimate
              | load at this level of displacement. The results from the cyclic tests are very similar to

text          | Figure 3.36 shows the damage to a flat conventional joint subjected to pure shear during
              | testing. Compared to the conventional corner joints (Figure 3.31), the cracks in the flat
              | joint tests of Series 3 and 4, where framing member crossed the gypsum panel
              | boundaries, remained fairly small as continuous wood members underlying the joint
              | inhibited large separations. As with the corner joint specimens, no damage was observed
              | to the joints until the joint compound began to crack (Figure 3.36a). This occurred at joint
              | displacements of less than 1.0 mm for most of the specimens. As the two sides of the
              | joint began to move relative to each other, the paper joint tape quickly broke and the joint
              | opened (Figure 3.36c). The onset of damage for the flat enhanced joints where pure shear
              | was applied was similar to that of the conventional joint. Figure 3.37 show the
              | progression of damage in one of these enhanced joints during testing. Unlike the
              | conventional joint with paper tape, the fiberglass in the enhanced joint continued to resist
              | loads at larger levels of deformation after initial joint compound cracking. Figure 3.37b
              | shows the joint after the compound cracked at ultimate loading. At this level of
              | deformation, the fiberglass tape is still intact and resisting load. At very large levels of
              | deformation (greater than about 20 mm), the fiberglass strands started to break as shown
              | in Figure 3.37c.

text          | For the Series 3 and 4 tests where flexure was applied over the joints, gaps often formed
              | in the joints after ultimate loading had been exceeded. These gaps would increase in
              | width if the other of the two joints in the specimen remained intact. Figure 3.38 shows a
              | Series 1 specimen where both joints failed nearly simultaneously and no large gaps
              | formed between the gypsum joints. Figure 3.39 shows a Series 3 test where only one of
              | the two joints failed during testing and a large gap formed between the gypsum on the
              | two sides of the joint on the bottom of the panel. These figures demonstrate the effect of
              | tension across the joint in reducing the strength and increasing damage to the joint. These

title         | 3.2.5 Summary
blank         | 
text          | A series of experiments were performed to determine the performance of gypsum-to-
              | gypsum panel edge joining techniques for both corner and flat joints. Flat gypsum panel
              | joints were tested in both pure shear and shear plus bending. Joints with and without
              | blocking were tested. Conventional gypsum joints utilizing a paper joint tape and a pre-
              | mixed joint compound were compared with a joint composed of a fiberglass tape with a
              | powdered compound hydrated with water and a concrete bonding adhesive.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | The conclusions from the experiments are summarized below.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |    1. For corner joints, no marked difference in performance was observed when using
              |        conventional and enhanced joints. This occurred because the geometry prevented
              |        adequate penetration of the joint compound into the joint. Joining tapes are also
              |        less effective for corner configurations.
              |    2. For unblocked flat joints subjected to pure shear, the enhanced joint achieved a
              |        strength about double that of the conventional joint (8 kN/m vs. 4 kN/m).
              |    3. The addition of blocking across the flat joints in pure shear increased strength by
              |        only about 10% to 20% for each joint type, but greatly increased ductility of the
              |        joint after cracking of the joint compound.
              |    4. Flat joints subjected to shear and bending sustained somewhat smaller peak loads
              |        than joints subjected to shear alone, but the enhanced joint showed strengths
              |        about 80% higher than the conventional joint (7 kN/m vs. 4 kN/m). For joints
              |        subjected to shear and bending, blocking increased joint ductility and limited the
              |        width of the crack that formed between adjacent panels.
              |    5. Damage was first observed in all joints when the strength of the joint compound
              |        was reached. This damage was characterized by a small crack at the joint. Joint
              |        shear stiffness prior to cracking was very large in all test cases. In all cases, joint
              |        damage requiring repair was observed at very small panel-to-panel deformations
              |        (less than 0.5 mm). This highlights the need to control deformations in light-frame
              |        gypsum sheathed walls to limit repair costs.

title         | 3.3 Stucco-to-framing connection tests
text          | Stucco is commonly used in many residential structures in the United States as an
              | exterior finish because it is durable and relatively inexpensive. Furthermore, stucco is an
              | excellent fireproofing finish and is low maintenance. In most cases, stucco is installed
              | over wood structural panels such as rated plywood or oriented strand board (OSB), with
              | the latter being the preferred material in post-1990 construction due to lower cost and
              | similar performance when compared to plywood (AFPA 2008). Other possible stucco
              | substrates are exterior gypsum sheathing, glass mat sheathing, and cement board. The
              | stucco substrate is typically overlaid with two layers of asphalt building paper as a water
              | barrier and a light metal lath reinforcement. Dowel stucco fasteners (staples, screws, or
              | nails) are then added that penetrate the lath, paper, substrate, and wood framing. A
              | portland cement plaster stucco is usually applied in three layers for a total stucco
              | thickness of 22 mm (7/8 in). The stucco fasteners are often 25 mm (1 in) crown staples or
              | 38 mm (1-½ in) gauge 11 furring nails. Both connection types are rather flexible and can
              | withdraw from the framing members. In some cases, the stapes do not even penetrate the
              | steel hardware often found at stucco wall edges and at expansion joints. An edge fastener
              | spacing of 152 mm (6 in) is commonly used. The installation of the stucco fasteners is
              | critical since these are the sole elements that transfer forces between the stucco and the
              | framing members. While the use of a wood or gypsum sheathing substrate is common in
              | order to provide a level surface over which to apply the building paper, the substrate is
              | not required and the building paper may be floated directly over the wood framing. This
              | method is called open stud construction.

text          | While stucco is typically considered only as an architectural finish material, its presence
              | in light-frame buildings can markedly increase lateral stiffness and strength. In a
              | progressive shake table test program of a wood framed house with different amounts of
              | finish material installed, Filiatrault et al. (2009) found that the addition of conventional
              | stucco cladding increased the lateral stiffness of a test structure by about 30 % in each
              | direction. When subjected to dynamic loading, the stucco-clad house experienced a

              | only structural shear walls and shear walls with interior gypsum partition walls,
              | respectively.

text          | Researchers have also investigated different types of stucco-to-framing fasteners on
              | connection and wall performance. Pardoen et al. (2000) tested two types of stucco walls
              | as part of an extensive experimental program on wood framed walls. They found that 38
              | mm (1-1/2 in) furring nail fasteners increased the racking strength of stucco walls by 15
              | % (on average) as compared to stucco walls constructed with 25 mm (1 in) crown staple
              | fasteners. Mastschuch (2002) and Sofali (2008) investigated the behavior of a new
              | stucco-to-framing fastener that uses large steel sleeves over nail fasteners to better engage
              | the stucco in shear. Test results indicated that these stucco fasteners could resist up to 3
              | kN (670 lbs) each, and stucco walls built with these fasteners were about three times
              | stronger than those built with conventional crown staples as stucco-to-framing
              | connectors. Arnold et al. (2003) tested a series of stucco clad walls on wood framing
              | using open stud construction and tracked the progression of damage. They found that
              | cracking around wall openings occurred at drifts as small as 0.2%. In order to engage the
              | stucco cladding, professionals have recognized the need to use stucco fasteners that are
              | sufficiently embedded into the framing member and provide a separation between the
              | metal lath reinforcement and the building paper interface with the framing. Benjamin
              | Schmid, a professional engineer, developed a ring shank stucco nail with two heads as to
              | provide a distance between the lath and stucco backing (Schmid 2005b).

text          | A series of experiments were performed to determine the behavior of stucco-to-wood
              | fasteners of different geometries and to explore the use of stronger fasteners that would
              | lead to a better incorporation of the stucco in the lateral resisting system of residential
              | construction. Three different stucco-to-wood framing fasteners were tested. Figure 3.40
              | shows the three tested fasteners and Table 3.7 lists the dimensions of the tested fasteners.
              | The first fastener tested is a typical self-furring nail. These types of fasteners are typically
              | used for stucco construction and provide higher strengths than 25 mm (1 in) crown stapes

text          | that are frequently used (CoLA 2001). This occurs because the cross-sectional area of the
              | furring nails is larger. The furring nails also include a paper spacer under the head that
              | ensures deeper embedment within the stucco than staples, which are often only
              | superficially embedded in the stucco. The second fastener tested is a 16d ring-shank nail,
              | which is significantly longer and has a thicker shank than the self-furring nail. Since tests
              | of stucco walls have shown that failure sometimes occurs when the fastener withdraws
              | from the wood framing, a ring-shank nail was selected as to reduce the likelihood of
              | fastener withdrawal. The third fastener tested was a #14 hex screw with a self-drilling tip
              | to facilitate in penetrating steel hardware along the wall perimeter and at expansion joints
              | This fastener had the largest diameter (almost twice that of the self-furring nail) and
              | included a rubber and steel washer under the head for improved stucco embedment.
              | Furring was required between the steel stucco mesh and the framing member. The furring
              | nail includes a cardboard disc that serves as a furring spacer. For the other fasteners, 6.4
              | mm (0.25 in) rubber washers were placed between the framing member and the metal
              | lath around the shank of the fastener.

text          | The stucco-to-wood framing fasteners were tested in panel specimens that measured
              | roughly 600 mm (24 in) square. The specimen panels are shown in Figure 3.41. The
              | panels were framed on three sides, with the bottom piece of framing larger than the others
              | in cross-section (102 mm x 102 mm) as to allow bolting to the test table without member
              | splitting. The fourth side of the panel (on the right side on Figure 3.41a) was framed with
              | a stud to which the test fasteners were placed. The framed portion away from the test stud
              | (left side of the panel in Figure 3.41a) was covered in plywood on both sides to give
              | rigidity to the panel away from the stucco joint and ensure failure at the test stud. The
              | plywood ended about 150 mm from the edge of the test stud as to provide a clear section
              | of stucco next to the fastened edge. The panel was then covered with grade D building
              | paper and a self-furring 17 gauge steel stucco lath with 38 mm (1-½ openings). Two
              | specimens included a second layer of steel lath in a 100 mm (4 in) strip along the test stud
              | for added reinforcement. The dowel fasteners were placed in the test stud at a spacing of
              | 102 mm (4 in) on center. The lath was attached to the other framing members and to the
              | plywood with an excess of fasteners as to ensure that failure of the stucco occurred along
              | the test stud. Stucco was then applied in three layers. A standard stucco mixture was used

              | used for the finish coat, which had finer aggregates and a white appearance. The first
              | layer of stucco was 9.5 mm thick. This scratch coat was roughed up with a trowel to
              | provide better bonding with the next layer. The 9.5 mm thick brown boat was installed
              | next, followed by the 3.2 mm finish coat. At least 7 days were provided between the
              | application of each layer to ensure proper curing. The panels were covered in plastic to
              | ensure stucco hydration during these periods. Stucco cylinders were created out of the
              | mix batches used for the scratch and brown coats for these panels. The measured strength
              | and modulus of elasticity of the stucco used for these panel tests are summarized in Table
              | 3.8. The eight panel fastener tests were performed with stucco covering both sides of the
              | panel. For these tests, no stucco substrate (e.g., wood panel) was used and only building
              | paper separated the test stud from the stucco. Two additional tests were performed where
              | adhesive-attached gypsum wallboard was installed on one side and stucco on the other.
              | For these two tests, the stucco was placed on top of a gypsum glass-mat sheathing

text          | The strengths and initial stiffnesses of the stucco connection tests are shown in Table 3.9.
              | As noted, the strengths and stiffnesses are for a one-sided connection, except for the
              | specimens where one side was covered in stucco and the other in gypsum. In those cases,
              | two-sided values are reported. The conventional stucco self-furring nail fasteners reached
              | a strength of 13.0 kN/m, while the other larger fasteners reached strengths between 13.8
              | and 18.2 kN/m, with all larger nail and screw fasteners displaying similar strengths. No
              | significant difference in initial stiffness was detected between the different dowel
              | connections when stucco alone was tested without gypsum or a substrate. For the stucco
              | connection utilizing ring-shank nails and added steel reinforcement around the fastener
              | heads, no difference in behavior was observed when compared to comparable specimens
              | without the supplemental reinforcement. The average strength of the #14 screw connector
              | connection was larger than the average of any other tested connection type and 30%
              | larger than the average strength of the conventional self-furring nail connection. The

              | Again, one-sided forces are used for the stucco-only connection, while two-sided forces

              | on larger displacement amplitude cycles, the strength and stiffness reduce substantially
              | upon trailing cycles when compared to the leading loading cycles. At this scale, the
              | hysteretic shape of the stucco connection on a glass mat gypsum substrate with adhesive-
              | attached gyspum on the other side appears to be quite similar to that of the stucco alone
              | when deformations are large. One difference is that the enhanced stucco-gypsum
              | connection retains less strength at large connection displacements than the stucco only
              | connection. This occurs because the adhesive gypsum-to-framing connection fails at a
              | very small deformation. However, the ultimate strength of this connection is about twice
              | that of the one-sided stucco alone.

text          | Though the hysteresis plots clearly show signs of damage at small amplitude cycles,
              | damage was often not observed visually until larger levels of deformation. The first
              | visual evidence of damage usually occurred when the stucco layer separated from the
              | steel weep screed, which was attached to the framing. This separation would sometimes
              | manifest as a small crack in the stucco at the boundary with the weep screed (Figure
              | 3.46). At larger levels of deformation, other damage mechanisms were observed. For one
              | specimen, at about 11 mm of joint displacement, the scratch and brown coat layers of
              | stucco on one side of the panel separated. This damage can be seen in Figure 3.47. This
              | could have occurred because the scratch coat was not sufficiently rough or wet, prior to
              | the application of the brown coat, to ensure adhesion. In many specimens tested, no
              | additional damage was visually observed until the specimens were deconstructed.
              | However, some specimens developed cracks through the stucco layer. Figure 3.48 shows
              | cracking at the weep screed boundary into the stucco at 25 mm of connection
              | deformation. This mode of damage was observed more often in cases where connection
              | strength was high, such as when #14 screws were used as the stucco fasteners.

text          | A series of ten panel tests were performed to quantify the behavior of conventional and
              | enhanced dowel stucco-to-wood framing connections. Eight tests were of stucco
              | connections to framing without a stucco substrate. Another two panels tested a stucco
              | connection on a paperless glass mat gypsum substrate on one side, with adhesive-
              | enhanced gypsum wallboard on the other. Important observations from this series of tests
              | include:

              |        increases of about 30%, when compared to conventional furring nail connections.
              |        The peak strength of these lag screw connections were about 17 kN/m (1.2
              |        kips/ft).
              |    2. The addition of supplementary stucco reinforcement around fastener heads was
              |        not observed to improve connection performance.

text          |   3. Stucco-gypsum connections where one side was covered using adhesive-enhanced
              |      gypsum wallboard and a glass mat gypsum substrate was used on the stucco side
              |      showed strength about twice as high as the one-sided stucco connection alone.
              |      Initial stiffness was at least twice as high due to the use of adhesive connecting
              |      the sheathing material to the wood framing.
              |   4. Initial observable connection damage to stucco occurred at about 4 mm of
              |      displacement, with the stucco panel separating from the steel weep screed.
              |   5. At larger levels of deformation, some stucco panels cracked, while the layers of
              |      stucco separated from each other in one specimen. Fracture of the stucco fasteners
              |      occurred in many of the specimens, but was not observed until specimen
              |      deconstruction. This may present challenges in actual construction, as loss of load
              |      carrying capacity in the stucco connection may not be apparent after an
              |      earthquake.

title         | 4.1 Background
text          | Wood and cold-formed steel framed shear wall structures are the most commonly used
              | type of construction for residential low-rise buildings in the United States and Canada
              | due to their low cost, ease of construction, and ability to resist lateral forces. Though
              | light-frame residential structures are effective in terms of collapse safety, they can
              | deform considerably during strong earthquake shaking, leading to extensive damage,
              | costly repairs, and displacement of occupants.

text          | Designers of light-frame structures generally rely on seismically rated sheathed shear
              | wall panels for earthquake resistance, often ignoring entirely the resistance provided by
              | partition walls sheathed with gypsum wallboard. Though the lateral resistance of these
              | walls is either not accounted for or penalized in current design by the use of smaller
              | strength modification coefficients, they can contribute considerably to the resistance of
              | earthquake forces (Uang and Gatto 2003). While gypsum wallboard provides less
              | strength and stiffness than wood or steel wall panels, gypsum sheathed walls are less
              | expensive and generally plentiful in the floor plans of residential structures. Gypsum
              | wallboard is also generally used to cover structural OSB or plywood sheathed walls.
              | Harnessing the strength and stiffness of these gypsum-sheathed walls can hence reduce
              | the seismic deformations in light-frame structures, leading to reduced damage. With both
              | wood and cold-formed steel framing, the seismic behavior of light-frame walls depends
              | primarily on the fastening (typically nails or screws) between the framing elements and
              | the sheathing material. Therefore, the shear contribution of gypsum partition walls can be
              | enhanced by creating stronger and stiffer connections between the framing and sheathing.

text          | The behavior of sheathed light-frame walls is controlled by the connection between
              | wallboard and framing elements. While several researchers have investigated the
              | behavior of nail fasteners used with plywood and oriented strand board (OSB) sheathing,
              | less focus has been given to screw fasteners applied to gypsum drywall. Patton-Mallory
              | and McCutcheon (1987) tested a series of walls sheathed with plywood, gypsum, or a
              | combination of both using nail and screw fasteners. Their results showed that the strength
              | and stiffness of gypsum sheathed walls can be significant when compared to plywood
              | walls. Karacabeyli and Ceccotti (1996) tested a series of wood framed walls sheathed
              | with plywood, OSB, and gypsum. They noted that determining a yield point for light-
              | frame walls was difficult, as the force-displacement backbones were highly nonlinear for
              | all walls tested, even at small levels of deformation. In tested walls that utilized OSB and
              | gypsum wallboard together, they noted that the force-displacement relationship could be
              | approximated up to a racking drift of about 1% by adding the contribution of each
              | material. However, at larger drift levels, this was not found to be an accurate estimate of

text          | wall racking behavior. McMullin and Merrick (2002) tested a series of wood framed
              | gypsum walls with various opening configurations. They observed wallboard and
              | fastener damage at drift levels smaller than 0.5%. In some experiments, anchor rods were
              | used to hold the loading beam at the top of the wall to the strong floor. In instances where
              | these rods were not used, smaller strengths were observed as well as large uplifts around
              | interior openings without hold-down devices. They also observed that so-called “floating
              | edge” construction, where fasteners are not included on the upper portion of the gypsum
              | wall, did not lead to reduced or delayed damage during racking as has been supposed.
              | The same authors (McMullin and Merrick 2007) performed testing to demonstrate the
              | effect of using different types of dowel fasteners with different fastener spacing on
              | gypsum-sheathed partition walls. They found that the actual strength of the tested
              | partition walls was often much higher than the codified design strength. Additional
              | studies have been carried out to investigate the performance of wood framed walls
              | sheathed with gypsum and screw fasteners with similar observations (Pardoen et al. 2000;
              | van de Lindt 2004).
blank         | 
text          | In addition to tests using wood framing, several researchers have investigated cold-
              | formed steel framed walls with gypsum sheathing. Serrette and Ogunfunmi (1996) tested
              | several types of gypsum-sheathed walls with and without diagonal shear straps to provide
              | further shear resistance. They noted that framing elements alone contributed very little to
              | the racking resistance of cold-formed steel framed walls and that the use of 12.5 mm
              | gypsum sheathing provided more shear resistance than 20 gauge steel straps placed
              | diagonally across the framing members. Screw rotation at the edge framing members was
              | observed as well as gypsum crushing around fastener heads near peak loading.
              | Nithyadharan and Kalyanaraman (2012) tested a group of cold-formed steel framed shear
              | walls with calcium silicate board. Fastener tilting and crushing of the silicate boards was
              | observed when peak loading was reached. Walls tested with a vertical joint through the
              | center of the wall reached similar strengths as those with continuous sheathing, but were
              | more flexible in racking. A set of cold-formed steel framed walls with steel and OSB
              | sheathing were tested by another research group, with gypsum wallboard added in one
              | instance (Fülöp and Dubina 2004a). During these tests, cracking at gypsum panel edges

text          | was observed. The presence of the gypsum wallboard in addition to the OSB sheathing
              | increased racking strength by about 30%. Salenikovich et al. (2000) tested a series of 12
              | m (40 ft) long cold-formed steel framed shear sheathed with various sheathing types and
              | including different opening patterns. They observed that walls without openings were
              | significantly stronger and stiffer than walls with openings, but were less ductile. They
              | also noted that conventional strength penalty factors for perforated shear walls were
              | conservative.
blank         | 
text          | While a few researchers have noted that structural adhesives may be effective in
              | providing increased strength and stiffness to light-frame shear walls, the use of adhesive
              | to fasten framing to wallboard for seismic resistance is explicitly prohibited by the
              | building code due to the relatively brittle mode of failure in the adhesive. The 2008
              | Special Design Provisions for Wind and Seismic (AFPA 2008) states: “C4.3.6.3.1
              | Adhesives. Adhesive attachment of shear wall sheathing is generally prohibited unless
              | approved by the authority having jurisdiction. Because of the limited ductility and failure
              | modes of rigid adhesive shear wall systems, such systems are limited to seismic design
              | categories A, B, and C and the values of R and Ω0 are limited.”
blank         | 
text          | Despite of the stance of code bodies in recognizing the use of adhesives for seismic
              | resistance in light-frame structures, a few researchers have investigated the influence of
              | using such connection techniques. Oliva (1990) tested a series of wood framed walls that
              | used nails and construction adhesive to attach gypsum wallboard panels to framing.
              | While no hold downs were used and the shear anchors allowed considerable sliding at the
              | base of the walls, this study found that the use of adhesive in addition to nails increased
              | strength by 160% and stiffness by 230% when compared to gypsum walls with nail
              | connections only. While wall damage was concentrated at the gypsum-to-framing
              | fasteners at small deformations, the gypsum near the sill plate of the adhesive walls failed
              | at larger racking drifts. Filiatrault and Foschi (1991) tested wood framed walls where
              | structural plywood sheathing was attached using a high strength synthetic elastomer
              | wood adhesive. They found that the addition of adhesive increased initial wall racking
              | stiffness by 65% and increased strength by 45% to 70%. The authors concluded that
              | better detailing could prevent brittle failure of the framing members, resulting in even

text          | higher wall strengths. Dolan and White (1992) called for special attention to anchorages
              | and tie-downs in walls where adhesives are used. They noted that the high shear loads
              | experienced in adhesive walls could cause failure of these components if not properly
              | designed. Serrette et al. (2006) tested a series of cold-formed steel framed shear walls
              | where structural adhesive was used in addition to screws to attach sheathing to framing.
              | Both steel sheets and OSB sheathing were used. In their study, failure in the shear walls
              | usually occurred in the adhesive interface between the framing and sheathing. The
              | authors noted that wall strength exceeded values given by the International Building
              | Code (IBC 2006) for similar walls sheathed using conventional screws. They also noted
              | that when adhesives are used, the initial racking stiffness is high and fairly linear until the
              | adhesive connection breaks. Dinehart et al. (2008) performed connection and framed wall
              | tests where a viscoelastic material was glued between sheathing and framing. Though the
              | primary goal of their research was to provide increased energy dissipation in the visco-
              | elastic material, the glued connection also increased wall strength and stiffness
              | considerably.

text          | The increased wall strength and stiffness achieved with adhesive-attached sheathing has
              | the dual benefit of reducing both elastic and inelastic drifts. In particular, Ruiz‐García
              | and Miranda (2003) found that the drift in short period structures tends to be much more
              | sensitive to lateral strength than in more flexible, moderate and long period structures.
              | Since light-frame low-rise structures usually have short periods of vibration, the use of
              | adhesive could lead to significant reductions in inelastic lateral deformations and
              | therefore seismic damage, mitigating associated economic losses and other societal
              | impacts such as displaced building occupants.

              | 40% and limited structural drifts to about one-quarter that of the building without
              | finishes. The building with gypsum and stucco was also found to produce less

              | downs and shear anchors were instrumented to measure the reaction forces. The authors
              | observed that the wood framed house was able to redistribute and share loads between
              | walls during inelastic lateral loading. They also found that at small-displacement
              | amplitude cycles, the percentage of the lateral load resisted by out-of-plane walls was
              | small (4%), but increased as the building was loaded inelastically (14%).

text          | Mosalam and Mahin (2007) tested a three-story wood framed structure with tuck-under
              | parking on the first floor. The building was sheathed with plywood on the exterior, then
              | tested in phases, with each phase including a higher level of finish. They found that the
              | addition of gypsum and stucco finishes reduced the drift in the open first floor wall line
              | by a factor of 2.3, while increasing story shear demand by a factor of 1.2. The addition of
              | finish materials also reduced the torsional effects of the open ground-floor wall. At small
              | and moderate levels of ground shaking, cracks formed through the exterior stucco, while
              | damage was detected at the gypsum fasteners near the sill plate of interior walls.

              | when compared to the structure with exterior wood rated shear panels only. Cracks in the

              | at the same level of shaking, with large cracks and spalling occurring at the MCE level.

              | story wood framed structure with exterior OSB sheathing. Though no exterior finishes
              | were included, the interior walls and ceilings were sheathed with gypsum wallboard.

text          | Gad et al. (1999) tested a room enclosure framed with cold-formed steel and braced with
              | diagonal steel straps on the exterior and plasterboard on the interior. They noted that the
              | wall end returns dramatically improved the performance of each light-frame wall. This
              | was due to bearing of the plasterboard panels against the adjacent wall. The ultimate load
              | carrying capacity was increased more than three-fold due to the presence of wall returns.

text          | These full-building shake table tests have shown that finish materials such as gypsum and
              | stucco can provide significantly increased strength and stiffness to the lateral force
              | resisting system of light-frame structures. Neglecting these finishes in design often leads
              | to conservative designs. Additionally, each of these experiments showed that damage to
              | gypsum and stucco walls occurs at drift levels smaller than those that cause damage to
              | rated shear wall elements. Because the proposed strength- and stiffness enhanced
              | structures include strength- and stiffness-enhancements to both gypsum and stucco
              | materials, comprehensive wall, substructure, and structure testing were performed to

text          | To determine the effect of enhanced fastener behavior on wall racking performance, 1.22
              | m by 1.22 m (48 in by 48 in) wall panels were tested. The plans for the wall panels are
              | shown in Figure 4.1. The tests included five panels with wood framing and two panels
              | with cold-formed steel framing. The panels with wood framing included one with
              | conventional 41 mm coarse threaded screws, two with enhanced screws, and two with the
              | enhanced screws plus Adhesive 2. Two panels with cold-formed steel framing were
              | tested, one with 41 mm fine threaded screws and the second with screws and Adhesive 3.
              | See Table 3.1 and Table 3.4 for details concerning the utilized construction adhesives.
              | The wood framed panels had double top and bottom plates and double end studs to
              | accommodate large shear bolts to attach the specimen to the horizontal supports and
              | vertical hold-down anchors. Wall uplift was restrained by two Simpson HDU8 hold-
              | downs at each wall end attached to the double end studs. Wood and cold-formed steel
              | members were of the same size and type described previously for the fastener tests, and
              | the sheathing was 15.9 mm Type X gypsum wallboard. Vertical studs were spaced at 406
              | mm (16 in) on center with a perimeter coarse threaded drywall screw spacing of 178 mm
              | (7 in) and a field spacing of 305 mm (12 in). Adhesive was installed with a 10 mm
              | continuous bead, in the same manner as the connection tests. Screw fasteners provided
              | clamping to the adhesive connection during curing in addition to providing strength and
              | ductility after failure of the adhesive. Two wood framed walls, one using enhanced
              | screws alone and one with enhanced screws and adhesive, were built with the edge
              | fasteners attached to the inside member of the exterior double studs and plates. In other
              | walls, the edge fasteners were attached to the edge member of the double end studs and
              | plates. The cold-formed steel panels are similar except that only single top and bottom
              | plates were used. The screw heads were mudded and sanded for a smooth painted finish.

text          | The top of each wall was attached to a horizontal steel channel by 19 mm (¾ in) shear
              | bolts through the top header plate of the wall. This connection was designed to be strong
              | enough as to avoid damage at this location during testing. The loading channel was
              | connected to a 200 kN (45 kip) MTS actuator (model 201.45T) that was attached to a
              | reaction frame. As shown in Figure 4.1, the wall sill plate and vertical hold-downs were
              | attached to two steel support channels. Again, sufficiently strong, large diameter bolts
              | were used to avoid any damage at this location. Out-of-plane restraint was provided by
              | two steel angles pinned to the loading channel at the top of the wall at one end, and to the
              | strong floor at the other.

text          | Linear potentiometric transducers measured the horizontal displacement of the header
              | and sill plates of the wall as well as vertical uplift at the edge studs. As intended, very
              | little base sliding or vertical stud uplift occurred during testing.

              | step. This is slightly different than the loading protocol for the fasteners in that that
              | trailing cycles have the same amplitude as the initial cycle of each set. The maximum
              | wall drift of 2% corresponds to a deformation at the top of the wall of 51 mm (2 in).

blank         | 
text          | The strengths and initial stiffnesses of all walls tested are summarized in Table 4.1. The
              | reported peak strength is the maximum absolute strength in either loading direction while
              | the stiffness is the secant stiffness measured at 0.1% wall drift. When wood framing was
              | used, the walls with enhanced screws reached peak strengths more than 10% higher than
              | with conventional coarse threaded screws. The wood framed walls with adhesive and
              | screws had strengths almost double that of walls with screws only. For the cold-formed
              | steel framed walls, the addition of Adhesive 3 also nearly doubled the wall strength,
              | compared to the case with only screws. There was no observable difference in behavior
              | between the walls where edge fasteners were placed on the inner stud of the double studs
              | and plates, as opposed to when they were placed on the edge framing members. All walls
              | exceeded the code specified nominal shear capacity of 5.0 kN (corresponding to 2.0
              | kN/m or 140 lbs/ft) for gypsum walls with conventional screw fasteners (AFPA 2008) by
              | a factor of more than two. Augmenting drywall screw connections with adhesive
              | increased initial wall stiffness by a factor of two to three, when compared to walls with
              | screws only.

text          | The effect of adhesives in increasing the strength and stiffness of gypsum partition walls
              | was significant, though more drastic strength and stiffness increases were seen in the
              | tested fastener connections. This occurs in part because of a phenomenon illustrated in
              | Figure 4.3. A shear wall reaches its strength as the fasteners nearest to the perimeter of
              | the wall reach their strength. At this level of deformation, the fasteners closer to the
              | center of the panel are only resisting a fraction of their strength since the relative
              | deformation between the framing and the sheathing decreases from the perimeter to the
              | center of the wall. Since the adhesive reaches its peak strength at much smaller
              | displacements than screws and sheds load more quickly after strength is reached, walls
              | with adhesives will not reach strengths as proportionally high to adhesive gypsum-to-
              | framing connections (described in Chapter 3), when compared to screw fastened walls
              | and fasteners. The stiffness increase in walls with adhesive fasteners is also less
              | pronounced than that observed in fastener tests because flexibility from wall anchorages,
              | framing member bending, and sheathing shear contribute to wall stiffness in addition to
              | gypsum-to-framing fasteners.

text          | The hysteretic force-displacement behavior of wood framed walls with and without
              | adhesive in addition to screw fasteners can be seen in Figure 4.4. In the wall with
              | adhesive, the adhesive began to fail at a drift of about 0.25%. At displacements larger
              | than those corresponding to racking drifts of about 0.5%, the behavior of the two walls
              | was quite similar. This indicates that after the adhesive fasteners break, the screw
              | fasteners behave in a way similar to walls with screws alone. It is important to highlight
              | that the wall specimen with no adhesive required a lateral drift of about 2.0% to reach its
              | peak strength of about 13 kN; the wall specimen with construction adhesive reached
              | nearly twice the strength at a drift of only about 0.25%.

text          | The cyclic envelope curves and secant stiffness of each wall throughout testing are shown
              | in Figure 4.5. Only walls where fasteners were applied to the edge members of the double
              | studs and plates are shown in this figure. The adhesive walls were not only considerably
              | stronger and stiffer than walls with screws alone, but their cyclic envelopes remained
              | near or above that of the screw fastened wall even at large displacement cycles. As
              | mentioned before, peak strength in the wall specimens with adhesive was nearly twice
              | that of wall specimens without adhesive. At small drifts (less than about 0.1%), the wall
              | secant stiffness for the adhesive walls with screws was at least three times that of the
              | walls with screws only; the secant stiffness of the adhesive walls with screws was more
              | than double that of walls with screws only at all displacement cycles. This suggests that
              | not all of the paper-gypsum bonding failed when peak loading occurred and some paper-
              | gypsum bonding continued to contribute to the strength and stiffness of the walls at larger
              | displacement cycles. Interestingly, the peak stiffness of the wood framed wall with
              | conventional screws remained very similar to the stiffness of the cold-formed steel
              | framed wall with conventional screws throughout cyclic loading. The secant stiffness of
              | the wood framed adhesive wall with screws was more than 30% higher than that of the
              | cold-formed steel adhesive wall with screws before initial adhesive failure. Among the
              | wood framed walls, the specimens with enhanced screws were about 20% stronger and
              | 45% stiffer than the comparable panels with conventional screws. This is remarkable
              | since this increase in stiffness was not observed in connection tests. Since only one wood
              | framed wall with conventional coarse threaded screws was tested, this stiffness difference
              | could be partially due to specimen variability that cannot be captured with one specimen.

text          | The onset and progression of damage was also carefully documented during the various
              | wall tests. The surface of the gypsum wallboard around the screw fasteners at the wall
              | perimeter began cracking at racking drifts of about 0.2%. This level of damage
              | corresponds to that seen in Figure 4.6a. The fasteners along the wall perimeter were the
              | first to show signs of damage. When drift levels of about 0.5% were reached, a visible
              | gap between the fastener heads and gypsum had formed at the wall perimeter. At wall
              | racking displacements in excess of 2%, several edge fasteners failed. Fastener appearance
              | at this stage was similar to what is shown in Figure 4.6c. In some wall specimens,
              | cracking through the gypsum between fasteners at a corner of the framed wall was
              | observed at drift ratios of about 1.0% (Figure 4.7), though this damage may have
              | occurred because the gypsum wallboard contacted the steel channel used for loading at
              | this level of drift. There was no marked difference in the onset and progression of
              | damage when using different screw fastener and framing types. Damage to screw
              | fasteners initiated along the exterior studs and along the top and sill plates (Figure 4.8),
              | while damage along the intermediate field studs remained minor for the majority of walls
              | tested, even at relatively large levels of lateral deformation. In many cases, the edge
              | screws pulled through the edge of the gypsum wallboard at drift levels in excess of 1.0%
              | (Figure 4.9). At large levels of deformation, connected wood framing members separated
              | for some specimens (Figure 4.10). When cold-formed steel framing was used, buckling
              | of the stud members was observed at drift levels in excess of 2.0% (Figure 4.12). When

text          | adhesives were used, failure primarily occurred by the paper on the gypsum wallboard
              | tearing away from the gypsum (see Figure 4.11a). Since this damage occurred within the
              | thickness of the wallboard, the damage was difficult to detect until the wall panels were
              | deconstructed. Though the displacement thresholds for damage states were similar for
              | walls with and without adhesive in addition to screw fasteners, the forces resisted when
              | adhesives were present were much larger. When subjected to earthquake loading, this
              | increased wall strength and stiffness means that walls enhanced with adhesives will be
              | less likely to incur damaging drift levels than walls built with conventional screw
              | fasteners alone.

title         | 4.2.3 Summary
blank         | 
text          | Framed wall panels utilizing different screw and adhesive connections were tested
              | pseudo-statically. Wood framed walls built with enhanced screw fasteners were more
              | than 10% stronger and 40% stiffer than a wall built with conventional coarse threaded
              | screws. For both wood and cold-formed framed walls, walls built with construction
              | adhesive in addition to drywall screws were almost twice as strong and three times as
              | stiff as walls built with conventional screws only. The tested adhesive cold-formed steel
              | frame wall was nearly as strong, but about 30% less stiff than the adhesive wood framed
              | walls. While adhesives were found to markedly increase wall strength and stiffness,
              | adhesives provided a more modest enhancement to wall specimens than that previously
              | observed in sheathing-to-framing connections themselves. Walls with adhesive fasteners
              | provided increased peak cyclic stiffness and hysteretic energy dissipation throughout the
              | testing protocol when compared to walls built with screw fasteners alone.
blank         | 
text          | The normalized strength and stiffness of tested gypsum-to-framing fasteners and gypsum-
              | sheathed walls are shown in Figure 4.13. The responses have been normalized by the
              | strength and stiffness of conventional 41 mm screws and walls constructed with these
              | fasteners. While connection strengths increased more than four times when adhesive was
              | added to supplement screw connectors, the strengths for walls with adhesive were only
              | about two to four times larger than the conventional wall. Similar trends are seen in the
              | stiffness response. This occurs because the fasteners in different locations within a wall
              | specimen reach peak loading at different drift levels (Figure 4.3). So when one fastener or
              | adhesive connection has reached peak loading, adjacent fasteners are either still
              | approaching their strength or have surpassed it.

text          | Damage to screw fasteners began with cracking around fastener heads at a wall drift of
              | about 0.2%, with initial damage occurring around the wall perimeter. Adhesive fasteners
              | failed at wall drifts of about 0.25%. Using enhanced screw fasteners and adhesives did
              | not alter the drift levels at which damage was observed, though much larger racking loads
              | were carried at those drifts when adhesive was present.

text          | 4.3 Full scale gypsum and stucco tests by Hopkins
              |     (2013)
              | In addition to the set of walls tested at Stanford, a series of twenty larger 2.4 m high, 2.4
              | m and 4.9 m long gypsum and stucco framed walls on both wood and cold-formed steel
              | framing were tested by Professor Benjamin Fell and graduate student Amy Hopkins at
              | California State University, Sacramento (CSUS). Detailed data and analysis of those tests
              | can be found in the Hopkins’ thesis (Hopkins 2013; Hopkins et al. 2014). The results
              | from each of these tests will not be presented here, though important observations and
              | behavior from the overall test program are summarized and discussed.

text          | the walls also included end returns, which significantly affected wall behavior in most
              | cases. All screw fastener types and spacings were similar to the small scale walls tested at
              | Stanford. The details of the wall end return conditions used are shown in Figure 4.14.
              | Conventional and adhesive-enhanced gypsum walls were tested with both wood and
              | cold-formed steel framing. Wood framed walls sheathed with gypsum and stucco,
              | plywood, and glass mat gypsum sheathing were also tested to compare wall behavior.
              | The strengths, initial stiffnesses, and story drifts corresponding to peak loading of the
              | wood framed and cold-formed steel framed walls are shown in Table 4.3 and Table 4.4,
              | respectively. Cyclic loading protocols were used for all tested walls.

text          | For the wood framed 2.4 m square gypsum shear walls tested, the walls that included
              | adhesive between the gypsum and framing (W2 through W6) reached much higher
              | strengths and stiffnesses than the conventional gypsum wall (W1). Figure 4.15 compares
              | the hysteretic behavior of a conventional gypsum wall (W1) and a wall enhanced with
              | adhesive (W6). Both specimens featured wall end hold-downs and shear anchors spaced
              | at 406 mm (16 in). For these specimens, the enhanced walls using construction adhesive
              | were more than two times stronger and 2.6 times stiffer than the conventional gypsum
              | wall. The wall with strength and stiffness enhancements reached peak strength at a drift
              | level of about 0.3%, followed by a sharp decrease in strength. This corresponds to the
              | wall drift in which the adhesive around the wall perimeter failed. At large drifts (>1.0%),
              | the enhanced wall behaved very much like the conventional wall, with the drywall screws
              | continuing to provide racking resistance at drift levels exceeding 2.0%.

              | walls is shown in Figure 4.16 for drift levels less than 0.1%. Even at this small level of
              | racking deformation, the hysteresis curve of the conventional wall shows signs of
              | deterioration. The reloading stiffness is somewhat reduced from the initial stiffness loop
              | due to crushing of gypsum around the screw fasteners. In comparison, the adhesive-
              | enhanced wall displays a nearly-elastic hysteresis. Very little stiffness degradation can be
              | detected at this small level of deformation. The forces reached in these small
              | displacement amplitude cycles were nearly three times larger for the wall with adhesive-

text          | Figure 4.17 shows the hysteretic racking curves for the conventional and enhanced
              | gypsum walls at racking drifts up to 0.3%. At this level of deformation, both walls have
              | experienced damage and display reduced stiffnesses when compared to performance at
              | smaller amplitude loading cycles. The conventional wall shows a higher degree of
              | pinching than the enhanced wall at this level of deformation, with the tangent stiffness
              | degrading for a given racking drift in subsequent cycles when compared to the first cycle
              | at the same drift level. At this level of deformation, the adhesive connection at the sill
              | plate of the enhanced wall has begun to fail and the adhesive connections farther up in the
              | wall are slowly being broken as larger and larger deformations are reached. This failure
              | of the adhesive connection is manifest not only in the reduced racking stiffness, but in the
              | energy dissipation that is evident due to the large area within the hysteresis loops.

              | have dismissed the use of adhesives in light-frame walls because they are perceived to
              | fail suddenly and lead to increased collapse risk. While the strength of the enhanced wall
              | was observed to reduce significantly after the adhesive gypsum-to-wood connections
              | failed, the wall continued to provide substantial resistance even at large drift levels due to

title         | 4.3.3 Effect of wall hold-down conditions
blank         | 
text          | After the conventional wood framed gypsum wall was tested, a series of 2.4 m square
              | walls were tested (W2 through W5), varying the hold-down and shear anchorage
              | configurations. None of these walls included openings or end returns. The first wall
              | tested with adhesive enhancements (W2) was fitted with conventional hold-downs and
              | one shear anchor between each pair of adjacent studs. The hold-downs and anchors were
              | tightened to a tension of approximately 13 kN (3000 lbs) prior to gypsum attachment.
              | During testing of wall specimen W2, the gypsum fractured above the sill plate, with the
              | segment below that point remaining adhered to the plate member (Figure 4.18). This
              | failure began with a horizontal crack forming in the gypsum above the sill plate at a wall
              | drift of only 0.3%. The crack widened and propagated as wall drifts increased. This
              | failure occurred because the hold-down provided did not provide sufficient uplift
              | stiffness. The adhesive enhancement between the sheathing and framing members
              | provides a stiff force path to transfer the end stud uplift to the sheathing panel and then
              | back into the sill plate. In specimen W2, this force path was followed until the uplift
              | force of the enhanced wall at the area of the hold-down surpassed the tensile strength of
              | the gypsum. This failure of the gypsum at the sill plate led to lower strengths than were
              | anticipated for enhanced gypsum shear walls. This failure mechanism could be avoided
              | by providing a stiffer hold-down so that the majority of the uplift forces in the wall would
              | be transferred through this device and not through the adhesive and wallboard
              | components. Alternatively, the same hold-down could be used in the interior face of the
              | end stud and a steel strap could be placed under the wall and extend up the exterior stud
              | face.

text          | Three ways of addressing this flexibility in the stud uplift condition were devised and

              | pads were introduced under the shear anchor heads for specimen W3. This was done
              | because the shear anchors are intended to only resist shear forces along the bottom of the
              | wall, yet the installation of washer plates and tightening of the nuts over that plate lead to
              | a stiff load path for the end stud uplift forces to follow to the foundation. A neoprene pad
              | installed under a shear anchorage is shown in Figure 4.19.

              | was built and installed instead of the conventional commercially available hold-down
              | device. This device utilized thicker steel plates to increase device stiffness. This wall
              | sustained higher racking loads than walls with previously tested uplift restraint, but still
              | suffered breakage of the gypsum wallboard above the sill plate (Figure 4.20) before the
              | full strength of the adhesive-enhanced wall was realized.

text          | Cameras placed inside the wall permitted the observation that the flexibility of the hold-
              | down was occurring because as the wall racks, the hold-down prevents vertical motion at
              | the rod. But because of the eccentricity between this point and the studs, small rotations
              | take place that produce a small uplift of the end studs. This vertical uplift is quite small
              | (on the order of 1 mm). An illustration of this phenomenon is given in Figure 4.21. In
              | order to provide a stiffer load transfer path from the end stud in tension to the hold-down
              | device, a commercially available steel strap that wrapped around the exterior of the stud
              | member and underneath the wall specimen was installed using wood screws for the
              | subsequent specimen, W5 (Figure 4.22). This strap is aimed at minimizing the rotation of
              | the hold-down and significantly reducing the vertical uplift of the end studs.

text          | During the testing of specimen W5 which included this strap along the outside edge of
              | the end studs, no crack formed in the gypsum above the sill plate. This specimen reached
              | initial stiffnesses between 10% and 90% higher than the walls with no supplemental strap
              | installed at the hold-down. Additionally, wall racking strength was about 25% higher for
              | specimen W5 than for previous specimens that did not utilize the special stud hold-down
              | detail with the steel strap. This iteration of tests highlights the importance of stud hold-
              | down restraint when gypsum-sheathed walls are enhanced with adhesive gypsum-to-
              | framing connections. In order to fully develop the strength afforded by the adhesive,
              | boundary conditions must supply sufficient stiffness to transfer wall uplift to the
              | foundation. For the subsequent test specimens that included wall end returns, this
              | additional strap was not included and no cracking was observed in the gypsum above the
              | sill plate. This failure mechanism was not observed in walls with returns because the stud
              | members joining to the wall end stud were securely fastened to the wall end stud with
              | screws. Hold-down devices were also installed within the end return walls. These
              | additions provided increased uplift stiffness at the wall ends that inhibited the rotation of
              | the end holdown and corresponding uplift of the stud away from the sill plate. Since the
              | hold-down devices for cold-formed steel studs are placed inside the end stud members
              | and do not include a substantial eccentricity from the centerline of the end stud, this
              | failure mechanism caused by end stud uplift was inhibited when steel framing was
              | utilized. While hold-down stiffness was extremely important to develop the strength of
              | these test walls, the required hold-down stiffness could be reduced for walls with
              | significant gravity loads. The tested walls included no gravity loads, but previous
              | experimentation of walls with varying hold-down and gravity load configurations have
              | shown that the presence of gravity loads can drastically decrease the end stud uplift in
              | framed walls and allow for larger wall strengths (Johnston et al. 2006).

text          | hydrated with a mixture of water and a concrete bonding adhesive. During the testing of
              | walls W3 and W5, small hairline cracks formed on one side of each wall at the horizontal
              | joint boundary at racking drifts of 0.2% to 0.3%, but the joints stayed otherwise intact.
              | During wall construction, it was observed that sanding of the enhanced joint compound
              | was difficult due to the hardness of the cured joint compound. Sanding of the initial coat
              | of joint compound is necessary in order to create a smooth surface that can be painted and
              | finished. For specimen W6 and all subsequent walls tested as part of this program,
              | blocking was added to the wall at the joint between sheathing panels and conventional
              | paper tape and pre-mixed joint compound were used to provide continuity across the
              | joint. During testing of specimen W6, no cracking was observed through the horizontal
              | gypsum joint on either face of the wall. The racking stiffness of this wall that included
              | blocking was about the same as the similar tested wall with enhanced joint compound as
              | opposed to blocking (W5). However, the wall with conventional joints and blocking was
              | about 7% stronger than the comparable wall without blocking and enhanced gypsum
              | joints. This increase in strength could be due to the increased number of screw fasteners
              | along the blocking as well as the improved shear transfer through the blocked joint. For
              | other framed walls tested with returns, small cracks at the blocked joints sometimes
              | appeared, but this generally occurred at larger drifts (~0.75%), well past the drift
              | corresponding to peak wall loading.
blank         | 
text          | These test results indicate that providing continuity across horizontal gypsum joints is
              | critical in developing the strength and stiffness capacity of enhanced light-frame walls.
              | While this continuity can be provided by using an enhanced joint compound, using
              | conventional gypsum panel joining techniques may be easier for contractors to execute.
              | Additionally, these conventional gypsum joints do not present the added difficulty of
              | sanding a very hard joint compound. For this reason, the use of conventional gypsum
              | panel edge connections with wood blocking is recommended for strength- and stiffness-

blank         | 
text          | Wood framed wall specimens W8 through W11 all included wall end returns. These T-
              | shaped returns were framed according to the plan shown in Figure 4.14c. The first
              | specimen with returns, W7, included two hold-down devices in each return, but none
              | along the length of the major wall. The stud members between the major wall and the
              | returns were connected with wood screws spaced at 152 mm (6 in) on center. This test
              | was performed to determine whether, in the absence of hold-downs along the major wall,
              | uplift could be transmitted through the built-up end posts and into the ends of the return
              | walls. During testing of specimen W7, the connection between the end studs of the major
              | wall and the adjacent return studs failed before the full strength of the wall adhesive was

              | failed inter-stud connection along with resulting damage to the wallboard on the return
              | wall is shown in Figure 4.23. For the subsequent enhanced wall test specimens that

text          | Wall specimens W8 through W11 included T-shaped end returns. The major walls were
              | of varying length with two specimens including door openings. The behavior of the walls
              | with returns, especially those without openings, was markedly different that of walls
              | without end returns. Figure 4.24 shows the cyclic force-displacement curves for an
              | adhesive-enhanced wall without returns (W6) and another wall with T-shaped returns
              | (W8). Also shown is the hysteresis curve for a wall with L-shaped returns. Though no
              | adhesive-enhanced gypsum walls with L-shaped returns were tested as part of the test
              | program at CSUS, a room specimen utilizing L-shaped returns has subsequently been
              | tested at the University of California, Berkeley (Acevedo et al. 2014). The hysteresis
              | curve for that wall shown in Figure 4.24c has been normalized for the same wall length
              | as specimens W6 and W8. The wall with T-shaped returns sustained larger loads at large
              | racking displacements than the wall without returns. The wall is also significantly stiffer
              | initially than the wall without returns. In fact the wall with T-shaped returns is more than
              | 50% stiffer initially and 15% stronger than the wall without end returns. In comparison,
              | the wall with L-shaped returns behaves much like the wall without returns, though it
              | displays somewhat higher strength and stiffness and more force resistance at large
              | racking displacements. Figure 4.25 shows the cyclic envelope curves and cumulative
              | hysteretic energy dissipation for the enhanced wood framed walls with and without end
              | returns. The cyclic envelope curves are only shown for one direction of loading for
              | clarity, though all tests showed a high degree of symmetry in their force-displacement
              | behavior. The wall with L-shaped returns is not included in the energy plot because the
              | loading protocol differed from that used in the other wall tests. The enhanced gypsum
              | wall envelope curves show that while the T-shaped returns provide significantly
              | enhanced ductility and initial stiffness when compared to the wall without returns, the
              | wall with L-shaped returns provided initial wall racking stiffness and a cyclic force-
              | displacement envelope somewhere between that of the wall with T-shaped end returns
              | and the wall without returns. The plot comparing the energy dissipation for the wall with
              | T-shaped returns and the wall without is interesting in that it shows that the wall without
              | end returns experienced more hysteretic energy dissipation at small amplitude cycles than
              | the wall with returns. At larger amplitude cycles the rate of energy dissipation is larger
              | for the wall with T-shaped returns, largely because more force is being resisted in the

text          | The force-displacement curves at small displacement amplitude cycles for the enhanced
              | gypsum wall without returns and the wall with T-shaped end returns are shown in Figure
              | 4.26. At this level of deformation (0.1%), the racking behavior of both walls is quite
              | linear, with larger stiffness shown for the wall with end returns. It is also noted that the
              | area within the hysteresis loops is larger for the wall without end returns than the wall
              | with returns. The unloading curves in the wall with returns more closesly follow the

              | as the wall with returns racked, the sheathing panels were constrained by the adjacent
              | wall returns. Increased bending and uplift stiffness were also provided by the extra end
              | post material and hold-down restraint in the return walls. It is not believed that the out-of-

text          | Observations from the tested adhesive-enhanced gypsum sheathed walls at CSUS and
              | subsequent tests at the NEES@Berkeley lab by Acevedo et al. (2014) indicate that the
              | presence and configurations of wall returns significantly impacts the strength and in-
              | plane stiffness of enhanced light-frame gypsum walls. This increased stiffness is believed
              | to be due to increased wall bending and uplift stiffness which is supplied by the
              | additional cross-sectional material area and uplift restraint in the return walls. The walls
              | with end returns were somewhat stronger than walls without hold-downs and showed less
              | energy dissipation at small amplitude loading cycles than walls without returns. Walls
              | with T-shaped returns were stiffer than walls with L-shaped returns. When considering
              | the increased stiffness in these walls with returns, it is important to note that continuous
              | walls with T-shaped returns on both ends may be rare in conventional light-frame
              | construction. Exterior building walls most commonly include L-shaped returns, and many
              | interior walls will include openings or only include an L- or T-shaped return on one end
              | of the wall. If a wall contains only one end return, it is anticipated that the hysteretic
              | behavior will be un-symmetric. Another important observation from these tests with
              | varying end return configurations is that the presence of returns increases wall ductility at
              | large drifts.

text          | While the principal purpose of these enhanced wall experiments was not to test a wide
              | array of opening conditions in gypsum walls, two of the tested walls included door
              | openings measuring 0.8 m by 2.1 m (32 in by 84 in). Additionally, in a series of room
              | enclosure tests performed as part of this research program (Acevedo et al. 2014), an
              | adhesive-enhanced gypsum room enclosure with a door and two window openings was
              | tested. The results from this limited number of tests could help determine if conventional
              | methods of estimating perforated wall response are valid for strength- and stiffness-
              | enhanced light-frame systems. Sugiyama (1981) proposed a strength penalty factor called
              | the shear capacity ratio, which is used in conventional design procedures (AFPA 2008) to
              | estimate the reduced strength of light-frame walls due to openings. The shear capacity
              | ratio can be computed using Equation 4.1.

blank         | 
text          | Though most of the results from these tests that have been cited thus far are for enhanced
              | wood framed gypsum walls, many of the same trends were observed for walls where
              | cold-formed steel framing was utilized. Using adhesive enhancements in gypsum light-
              | frame steel walls increased strength and stiffness by roughly two times. The first steel
              | framed wall with returns (S3) used a strap for panel blocking at the wall mid-height. It
              | was found that because of the flexible nature of the steel strip, many of the fasteners
              | attached to the blocking did not form a firm connection with the blocking member and
              | failure at the gypsum connection occurred at small levels of deformation. For the
              | subsequent wall test with end returns (S4), a steel track was added to give out-of-plane
              | stiffness to the blocking strap (Figure 4.29). This was found to adequately strengthen the
              | gypsum connection and produced an enhanced wall with racking strength and initial
              | stiffness that were about 30% larger than that obtained for the wall with flexible strap
              | blocking.

              | both wood and cold-formed steel framing. In addition to increased strength and stiffness
              | in the wood framed wall, the hysteretic energy dissipated within the wood framed wall

text          | The decreased wall strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation occurred for a number of
              | reasons. First, screw fasteners connections in steel are more flexible than wood
              | connections because they are only restrained against rotation by a thin thickness of steel
              | and the screws in cold-formed steel tend to pivot around the point penetrating the steel
              | plate. This concept is illustrated in Figure 4.31. Whereas wood framing provides
meta          | CHAPTER 4. ENHANCED LIGHT-FRAME WALL TESTS                                             131

text          | continuous restraint against rotation along the fastener where it is embedded in the wood,
              | the steel framing only restrains a small portion of the fastener, allowing rigid-body screw
              | rotation as the sheathing slides across the framing. Also, as was noted in the gypsum
              | adhesive fastener tests (Chapter 3), adhesive gypsum-to-framing connections were
              | stronger when wood framing was used as opposed to steel. This occurred because wood
              | is porous and provided a better, rougher bond surface than the smooth steel, even when
              | the latter was sanded prior to the application of the adhesive. The steel framed walls
              | tested also included less surface area on which to place adhesive than the wood framed
              | walls. The actual width of wood 2 x 4 members is 38 mm (1.5 in), while the width of
              | standard steel studs is 35 mm (1-3/8 in). Additionally, the wood framed walls included
              | double top plates and thicker 3 x 4 sill plate members. Both plates for the steel framed
              | walls were of the standard 35 mm size. It is believed that the main reason for the
              | additional strength and stiffness in wood framing is due to the additional rotational
              | restraint of the screws, but the increased adhesive bond area provided in the wood framed
              | walls could explain, in part, why the strength and stiffness of these walls exceeded that
              | observed when steel framing was used.

title         | 4.3.8 Enhanced wood framed stucco walls
blank         | 
text          | In addition to walls sheathed with adhesive-enhanced gypsum, one wall was tested that
              | included adhesive applied gypsum on one side and enhanced stucco over an adhesive-
              | applied substrate of paperless glass mat gypsum sheathing on the other. These glass mat
              | gypsum panels prevent the formation of mold and retain their strength even when wet, so
              | are suitable for exterior applications. In recent years, they have been widely adopted,
              | especially for multi-unit housing and commercial construction. The configuration of the
              | stucco was the same as that used in the tested connections (Section 3.3) that included #14
              | coarse threaded screws spaced at 102 mm (4 in) along the wall perimeter, with a field
              | spacing of 178 mm (7 in). A standard 17 gauge stucco lath was provided. Both the
              | gypsum on the interior wall side and the glass mat substrate on the exterior were applied
              | using conventional coarse threaded drywall screws spaced at 178 mm on center along the
              | panel perimeter and 305 mm (12 in) in the field. A 10 mm diameter bead of adhesive was
              | used along all framing members in addition to the screw fasteners to attach the gypsum to
              | the framing. This wall included L-shaped returns on each end, which would be typical for
              | an exterior wall. Hold-down devices were included at the end of the major wall as well as
              | at the end of each return. The racking force-displacement curve for the tested 2.4 m
              | square stucco wall is shown in Figure 4.32. The peak strength of this wall was about
              | twice that of the enhanced gypsum walls. The initial stiffness was higher than that of the
              | adhesive-enhanced gypsum wall without returns (W6), but less than the wall with T-
              | shaped returns (W8). It is also noted that the peak strength is reached at about 1.0% wall
              | drift, a much larger drift level than the enhanced gypsum walls. The wall was only loaded
              | to about +/- 1.5% drift and substantial wall ductility could likely be achieved if the wall
              | had been tested to larger drift levels.

              | behaving in a nearly elastic manner. The stiffness had not degraded noticeably and the
              | amount of energy dissipated within each hysteresis loop was small. At this level of
              | deformation, the adhesive holding the gypsum wallboard and glass mat sheathing was
              | still intact in nearly all locations. By the time a wall drift level of 0.3% had been reached,
              | significant stiffness degradation had occurred. At this point of the hysteresis, much of the
              | adhesive around the wall perimeter had failed and the large screw stucco fasteners were
              | engaged and providing substantial resistance. These fasteners continued to provide
              | racking resistance at larger deformations.

title         | 4.3.9 Damage in enhanced gypsum and stucco walls
blank         | 
text          | The onset and progression of damage was tracked for all walls tested as part of this test
              | program. A complete record of wall damage can be found in Hopkins’ thesis (2013). The
              | following explanation is simply a description of common damage mechanisms and not an
              | attempt to characterize all incurred damage. Figure 4.34 shows the damage observed
              | throughout testing for specimen W6, an adhesive-enhanced wood framed gypsum wall
              | without end returns. Damage first appeared at a wall drift of only 0.3%, with cracks and
              | indentations forming around the heads of screws along the sill plate. At a drift level of
              | 0.4%, this same fastener damage was observed at the base of the wall along the end studs.
              | Beginning at 0.5% drift, the screw damage was observed along interior studs toward the
              | base of the wall. As the racking drift increased, the damage moved up the height of the
              | wall, but remained in the lower half throughout testing. Damage usually began at the base
              | of the wall, though in one specimen, damage was detected first at the top plate (W5). It is
              | believed that damage initiates at the wall base because some of the uplift forces from the
              | wall end studs are transferred through the adhesive, into the gypsum panel, then back into
              | the sill plate causing stress concentrations at the base corners of wall specimens and
              | initial adhesive damage at these locations. Also, the stiff boundary condition at the strong
              | floor cause stress concentrations in sheathing at these locations.
blank         | 
text          | A similar pattern of fastener damage progression was observed in walls with end returns.
              | However, a couple of additional damage modes were observed. At a very small drift of
              | about 0.1%, a small vertical crack formed at the gypsum boundary between orthogonal
              | walls. This damage was sometimes difficult to see and would be simple and inexpensive
              | to repair. At drifts exceeding about 0.75%, the gypsum on the major wall started to crush
              | against the return walls. This occurred because as the gypsum along the base of the wall
              | loosened due to adhesive and screw damage, the panels tended to remain stationary as the
              | wall racked. Since the returns constrained the gypsum panel, gypsum crushing occurred
              | at the base corners of the major wall. This damage mode contributed to the increased wall
              | ductility and strength-retention at large drift levels observed for walls with returns.

text          | damage to adhesive could not often be determined until the test specimen was

              | of view, determining whether an adhesive-enhanced gypsum wall has suffered adhesive
              | failure may be difficult to assess following a seismic event without deconstructing the
              | wall. Though only damage to wood framed walls was shown, the initiation and

              | separated from the gypsum panels on either side of the door. It was noted that damage to
              | screw fasteners focused not only on the bottom of the wall, but at the vertical studs
              | surrounding the door opening. These damaged fasteners, however, were observed at

text          | This series of enhanced gypsum and stucco wall tests showed that initial observable

              | deformation, dimpling and cracking occurred at the heads of screw fasteners, usually at
              | the sill plate, end studs, and studs surrounding wall openings. At around this same level

text          | base of walls with end returns crushed against the return walls. The stucco wall tested
              | similarly showed initial damage at about 0.3% drift, with small cracks forming along the
              | base corners of the wall. As drifts increased, these cracks widened and grew along the
              | height of the wall. It is important to note that in light-frame gypsum and stucco walls, not
              | all damage can be observed during testing. For example, failure of the adhesive
              | connection between framing and gypsum can often only be observed when removing the
              | gypsum wallboard, which may require carefully taking out wall screw fasteners. Damage
              | to the connection between screw fasteners and the gypsum itself may also not be
              | observed during testing if the stucco lifts off of the head of the fastener and slides over it.
              | These tests confirm that in order to limit damage to light-frame walls, wall racking drifts
              | must be limited to about 0.2% to 0.3%.

title         | 4.3.10 Summary
blank         | 
text          | A series of full-sized wood and cold-formed steel framed walls with adhesive-enhanced
              | gypsum sheathing and enhanced stucco were tested by investigators at CSUS (Hopkins et
              | al. 2014). The walls included variations in hold-down configuration, aspect ratio,
              | openings, wall end returns, and sheathing material. A summary of the key findings of this
              | test series are as follows:
blank         | 
text          |     1. Adhesive-enhanced gypsum partition walls reached strengths about two times that
              |         of conventional partition walls. Initial stiffnesses of enhanced walls were about
              |         two times that of conventional walls.
              |     2. To fully develop the strength of the enhanced gypsum walls, stiff hold-down
              |         conditions are required. Special considerations for wall hold-downs at wall ends
              |         without returns must be made to avoid rotation of the hold-down and pre-mature
              |         failure of the wall adhesive.
              |     3. Mid-height blocking along with conventional gypsum panel joining techniques
              |         are effective in transferring shear between gypsum panels. Enhanced joint
              |         compounds (Section 3.2) provided high strength, but still cracked at large loads
              |         and did not provide ductility across the joints. The cured enhanced joint
meta          | CHAPTER 4. ENHANCED LIGHT-FRAME WALL TESTS                                          140

text          |      compound was also very hard and difficult to sand, possibly making it an
              |      unattractive option for contractors.
              |   4. Walls with returns were stronger, stiffer, and more ductile than comparable
              |      enhanced walls without end returns. T-shaped end returns produced more stiffness
              |      than L-shaped returns. This increased stiffness is believed to be due to increased
              |      bending and uplift stiffness provided by the larger end posts and more hold-downs
              |      at the end of the major wall. The return walls also constrained the gypsum panels
              |      in the major wall, leading to increased strength, stiffness, and ductility.
              |   5. Walls with openings showed reduced strength and stiffness, when compared to
              |      walls with no openings. The strength and stiffness of walls and wall segments of
              |      various lengths were found to be roughly proportional to the inverse of the wall
              |      aspect ratio (H/ΣLi). Additional wall testing is needed to confirm the behavior of
              |      perforated light-frame strength- and stiffness-enhanced walls.
              |   6. Similarly to wood framed walls, adhesive-enhanced gypsum walls with cold-
              |      formed steel framing showed significantly improved racking strength and
              |      stiffness over conventional gypsum walls. However, adhesive-enhanced cold-
              |      formed steel framed walls were slightly weaker and more flexible than
              |      comparable wood framed walls. This occurred because the construction adhesives
              |      used did not bond as well to the smooth surface of steel as they do to porous
              |      softwoods. Also, the steel framed walls included less framing surface area on
              |      which to apply the adhesive.
              |   7. An enhanced wall using stucco on one side and adhesive-enhanced gypsum on the
              |      other reached a strength about twice that of a wall with enhanced gypsum alone.
              |      The initial wall racking stiffness was only slightly higher.
              |   8. Damage first appeared in enhanced gypsum walls with dimpling and cracking
              |      around screw fasteners, usually commencing at the wall sill plate starting at about
              |      0.2% drift. Cracking at orthogonal wall corners and corner panel crushing were
              |      observed in walls with returns. The tested stucco wall began cracking near its base

text          | While over the past several decades researchers have formulated dozens of models for
              | wood and cold-formed framed walls and structures, no specific modeling approach has
              | become standard. This likely is due to the computational rigor required to model each
              | component of light-frame structures accurately and the desire for more industry-friendly
              | analysis tools. The load path inherent in light-frame construction is complicated, as forces
              | are shared between sheathing panels, framing members, sheathing-to-framing fasteners,
              | sheathing edge connections, and anchorage hardware. Additionally, many of these
              | components behave in a highly non-linear fashion. The aim of many developed
              | computational tools has been to model light-frame walls and structures with a level of
              | detail that captures important behavior adequately without requiring undue modeling
              | effort and computational time.

blank         | 
text          | While many models have focused on capturing wall, diaphragm, and full structure
              | behavior, several researchers have developed models that predict the performance of
              | dowel fasteners in light framing. Many of these models are aimed at capturing the
              | nonlinear force-displacement behavior as well as strength and stiffness degradation and
              | pinching behavior observed in most light-frame fasteners. Some researchers have
              | developed models that capture the mechanics behind dowel-type fastener behavior, while
              | others have devised phenomenological models that include parameters that can be fit to
              | test data.

text          | Chui et al. (1998) developed a three-node beam element to model nail fasteners in wood
              | that considered material nonlinearities and fastener shear deformations. A separate two-
              | node spring element was developed to represent the embedment behavior in the wood
              | member. Fastener-to-wood friction was also represented. The model was validated with
              | experimental data of cyclically loaded nails in wood. Chui and Li (2005) later used an
              | adjusted model to capture the moment-rotation behavior of wood joints connected with
              | dowel fasteners. Foschi (2000) developed a simple fastener model using the material
              | properties of the fastener steel and embedded medium. The model could be used for
              | fasteners in single or double shear. He et al. (2001) developed a mechanics-based model
              | to represent dowel wood connections using a virtual work approach. The authors noted
              | convergence problems that can occur when fasteners approach failure or display tangent
              | stiffness that is nearly zero. The proposed models demonstrated good agreement with test
              | data when they were implemented in the finite element modeling of walls and small
              | three-dimensional (3D) structures.

text          | Empirical models for light framing fasteners have also been developed based on observed
              | test data. Kivell et al. (1981) used a bilinear pinching model to represent nailed timber
              | joints, fitting parameters to connection data from testing. Foliente (1995) developed a
              | phenomenological hysteretic model based on the Buoc-Wen-Baber-Noori (BWBN)
              | model (Baber and Noori 1985) and validated its use under static and dynamic loading. Xu

              | very good agreement with cyclically tested fastener data. Several others have suggested
              | empirical monotonic and hysteretic models based on the observed behavior of tested
              | fasteners (e.g., Stewart 1987; Dolan 1989; Ceccotti and Vignoli 1990; Folz and Filiatrault

text          | While the majority of fastener models for light-frame structures have been for dowel
              | fasteners, some models for adhesive connections have been developed. Serrano (2001)
              | used 3D finite element modeling to simulate rods glued into timber structures. The
              | model, which assumed a three-branch monotonic stress-slip curve, predicted the effect of
              | glue area and fracture energy in connection strength. Zink et al. (1996) used a bond-link
              | approach to model adhesive wood-to-wood connection using the finite element method.
              | Shear and normal stresses produced by the model were in good agreement with test
              | results. The authors recommended longer lap areas to reduce stress concentrations in
              | adhesive joints. Smardzewski (2002) modeled adhesive connections for wood furniture
              | using an energy approach. It was observed that shear stress concentrations became
              | highest at bond corners and that heterogeneities in the wood bond (i.e. air cavities)
              | increase the risk of adhesive failure.

text          | Gupta and Kuo (1985) developed a model that assumed sinusoidal and parallelogram
              | deformed shapes for wall studs and sheathing, respectively. The location of each fastener
              | within the wall was utilized to determine individual fastener contribution to lateral
              | stiffness using an energy approach. The models showed good correlation to monotonic
              | test data. Falk and Itani (1989) formulated a finite element model for wood diaphragms
              | that used a 20 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) transfer element to represent all sheathing-to-
              | framing fasteners within a single wall panel. The response of the model matched
              | monotonic diaphragm test data well while requiring 40% fewer DOFs than if each
              | fastener were modeled explicitly. Dolan (1989) created computer programs that
              | performed wall finite element analysis for the static and dynamic loading of wood shear
              | walls. In his models, beam elements were used for framing, plate elements for sheathing,

text          | and hysteretic spring elements for individual fasteners. The models simulated the
              | formation of gaps and bearing between adjacent framing members. Soon after, White and
              | Dolan (1995) developed a program that included elements to simulate bearing of adjacent
              | sheathing panels within a wall specimen. They also employed bilinear hysteretic fastener
              | models that could be loaded dynamically. Tarabia and Itani (1997) used distributed
              | stiffness elements along each sheathing-to-framing line to represent dowel fasteners. The
              | wall models captured peak deformations and ultimate loads well when compared to static
              | and dynamic wall test results. Dinehart and Shenton (2000) developed a model in which
              | each sheathing-to-framing fastener was modeled as a linear spring and viscous damper in
              | parallel. The model was able to capture dynamic wall behavior well at small levels of
              | deformation only. Folz and Filiatrault (2000; 2001) developed a tool called CASHEW
              | (Cyclic Analysis of SHEar Walls) that models the behavior of light-frame walls, with
              | individual un-oriented sheathing-to-framing nonlinear spring pairs representing screws
              | and nails. Framing members and hold-downs were considered rigid and the spacing of
              | fasteners was adjusted by the program to account for the unpredictable deformation
              | trajectory of sheathing-to-framing fasteners. The model was shown to simulate
              | monotonic, cyclic, and dynamic behavior that compared well with experimental results.
              | Fülöp and Dubina (2004b) developed a shear wall model for cold-formed steel structures
              | utilizing a tri-linear hysteretic model. The model was incorporated into equivalent lateral
              | wall bracing using a fiber hinge. Kanvinde and Deierlein (2006) developed a model for
              | gypsum-sheathed wood framed walls using the test data by McMullin and Merrick
              | (2002). Using their method, wall strength and stiffness were estimated using gypsum-to-
              | framing fastener density, the cumulative length of wall segments, and the bearing area of
              | the wall against end returns. The proposed monotonic and cyclic model captured the
              | behavior observed during testing well.

text          | Kasal et al. (1994) developed a finite element model for wood structures that used

              | walls tested statically with good agreement, though the model did not capture cyclic

              | incorporated into a full structural model that included rigid diaphragms using a computer

text          | While several researchers have verified finite element models for walls sheathed with

blank         | 
text          | The use of enhanced screws and adhesives in light-frame gypsum walls requires the
              | formulation of new analytic models to understand the effect of these connectors in walls
              | of different geometries. This section presents the formulation of detailed finite element
              | models built using the software Abaqus (Abaqus Analysis User Manual 2012) that
              | explicitly represent individual sheathing-to-framing fasteners, stud hold-downs, and
              | sheathing and framing elements in light-frame wood and cold-formed steel framed shear
              | walls. Uniaxial phenomenological fastener models were fit to experimental data of
              | hysteretic fastener response and model parameters for discreet screw and adhesive
              | fasteners are presented. Data from experimental wall panel racking tests is compared to
              | the predicted behavior of conventional and enhanced gypsum-sheathed walls. The
              | sensitivity of the finite element model behavior to certain model parameters is also
              | presented. The models presented capture the cyclic envelope curves and pinching
              | behavior of the experimental walls well. The described modeling approach is versatile
              | and could be applied to walls with varying boundary conditions, opening patterns, and

title         | 5.2.2 Gypsum-to-framing fastener models
blank         | 
text          | Sheathing-to-framing screw fasteners generally display an inelastic, degrading, pinched
              | hysteretic behavior when subjected to cyclic loading. The pinching behavior occurs
              | because upon initial and new displacement load increments, the screw bears against and
              | crushes the gypsum locally with little resistance under reverse loading until the
              | previously formed gap between the gypsum and the screw closes. At large displacements,
              | bending or fracture of screws can occur, leading to a negative post-peak slope on the
              | force-displacement envelope. Folz and Filiatrault (2000; 2001) developed a 10-parameter
              | model to capture the behavior of sheathing-to-framing fasteners as part of the CUREE-
              | Caltech Woodframe Project. The parameters of the CUREE fastener model are shown in

              | points are determined by the intersection of the pinching branch stiffness (determined by
              | r1) and the reloading stiffness (determined by Kp, which is controlled by α). To calibrate
              | this model to fastener test data reported in Chapter 4, the backbone parameters were first
              | defined by visually fitting the backbone curve to the cyclic test data. The cyclic data was

              | The behavior of the model is perfectly symmetric, while the test data shows slightly

text          | Tested adhesive gypsum-to-framing fasteners exhibited a highly elastic behavior until
              | just before the bond connection failed. In tests where adhesive only was used, strength
              | dropped abruptly at a fastener displacement of about 0.5 mm. In the wood framed
              | connection specimens, the adhesive itself did not fail and bonding failure typically
              | occurred through the thickness of the gypsum or in the paper-gypsum interface on both

text          | When gypsum panel edges meet in a shear wall, the flat joint is covered with tape and a
              | joint compound. This joint must be represented in the finite element modeling of gypsum
              | shear walls, as flexibility across the panel joints could lead to substantially reduced wall
              | strength and stiffness. Other researchers have recognized the need to model sheathing

text          | shear resistance is not modeled since most modeling efforts have focused on wood and
              | metal sheathings which do not employ joint compounds. However, testing done in this
              | research (described in Section 3.2) showed that these taped joints provide significant
              | strength and stiffness, so hysteretic springs were utilized in detailed finite element models
              | to model the effect of gypsum panel edge joints. The behavioral models were based on
              | test data on the tested flat gypsum joints in pure shear. As with the screw and adhesive
              | fasteners, the backbone of the model was first fit visually, then the hysteretic parameters
              | were fit by searching for combinations of model parameters that reduced the combined
              | force and energy error. Since tested gypsum panel joints without blocking behaved in a
              | brittle manner during testing, the same model that was used for adhesive connections was
              | used for gypsum panel joints, namely the modified Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler peak-
              | oriented model (Ibarra et al. 2005). The model behavior is shown in Figure 5.3. Again,
              | the hysteretic degradation parameters were not utilized for these connections. Figure 5.5
              | shows the force-displacement relationship of a tested conventional gypsum panel joint
              | along with the fitted Modified Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler model. The model displays a

              | reached, both models show similar amounts of energy dissipation (i.e. area in the
              | hysteresis loops), though the tested joint shows more of a pinched behavior. Since the
              | joint fails at a very small displacement and provides virtually no resistance after about 2
              | mm of displacement, the error produced in the wall models by not precisely matching the
              | hysteretic shape should not be large. Figure 5.6 shows the cumulative hysteretic energy
              | dissipation from the tested specimen and the model. While the energy dissipation is
              | similar, the model dissipates energy at a slightly higher rate after the joint strength is
              | reached. It should be noted that the energy dissipated by joint failure is very small
              | compared to that absorbed by sheathing-to-framing fasteners because of the brittle nature
              | of the joint connections.

text          | In addition to enhanced gypsum-to-framing fasteners, enhanced screw stucco-to-framing
              | connections were tested (Section 3.3). In order to model the enhanced stucco wall tested
              | as part of this program, the behavior of enhanced stucco-to-wood framing connections
              | must be characterized. Based on the observed behavior of the tested stucco screw
              | fasteners, the CUREE hysteretic model (Figure 5.1) was selected to represent screw
              | gypsum fasteners. Figure 5.10a shows the force-displacement relationship of a two-sided
              | connection with adhesive-enhanced gypsum on one side and enhanced stucco on an
              | adhesive-attached glass mat gypsum substrate on the other. The enhanced gypsum side
              | (interior) was modeled using the screw and adhesive parameter models presented
              | previously, while the stucco side was modeled using the CUREE model. This stucco side
              | fastener represents both the connections of the glass mat gypsum attached with a 9.5 mm
              | bead of adhesive and drywall screws at 178 mm on center as well as the stucco
              | connections at 102 mm on center. Figure 5.10b shows the two-sided model behavior with
              | the fitted gypsum fastener connection used on the stucco (exterior) side. The combination
              | of models for the connections on each side of the wall reasonably captures the force-
              | displacement hysteresis seen in testing. The behavior from testing is less symmetric, but
              | the cyclic envelope and the general hysteretic shape and pinching properties compare
              | well with the analytic connection model.

text          | Analytical wall models were developed in the Abaqus (Abaqus Analysis User Manual
              | 2012) finite element platform for each tested specimen. In the following model
              | description, the Abaqus material and element specifications are shown next to each
              | described component in parentheses. The wall studs were modeled using elastic beam-
              | column (B31) elements with a rectangular cross section (RECT). A detail of the
              | connections between framing members is shown in Figure 5.12 along with an overall
              | schematic view of a finite element wall model. The framing members were pinned in the
              | shear direction and out-of-plane of the wall, but vertical separation between the plates
              | and the studs was permitted. In locations where hold-downs were present, the vertical
              | restraint of the hold-downs was modeled as an elastic spring with the uplift stiffness
              | equal to that of the hold-down used in the tension direction and a very large stiffness (ten
              | times the uplift stiffness) used in the compression direction to simulate stud end bearing.
              | The uplift stiffness of hold-downs was calculated using data from the manufacturer’s
              | catalog by dividing the allowable strength of the hold-down by the deformation given at
              | that force level. The hold-downs were modeled using a user-defined subroutine (UEL).

text          | tension stiffness was set to be very small. Shear anchorages along the sill plate were
              | considered to be pinned at anchorage locations. This was done because most of the uplift
              | due to wall racking is expected to occur at the hold-downs and the vertical flexibility of
              | shear connections is less critical because of their location away from the end studs. The
              | gypsum wallboard was modeled using elastic quadrilateral plane stress shell elements
              | (S4R). In many specimens, the mesh size of the shell elements was controlled by the
              | spacing of the sheathing-to-framing fasteners. A maximum mesh size of 102 mm (4 in)
              | was used in all specimens described in this chapter, unless otherwise noted. The
              | mechanical properties of the framing, gypsum, and hold-downs used are shown in Table
              | 5.5. The geometric properties of the utilized wood framing and gypsum sheathing were

text          | Gypsum-to-framing fasteners were modeled using inelastic springs that employed the
              | calibrated CUREE and Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler models for screw and adhesive
              | connections, respectively. Since the fastener springs are uniaxial elements, two
              | orthogonal nonlinear springs are necessary to produce a model to capture the two-
              | dimensional resistance (i.e., components in the x- and y-directions). Judd and Fonseca

text          | This oriented spring pair approach was used to model each screw and adhesive fastener in
              | the wall specimens. User-defined subroutines were written in Fortran for both the
              | CUREE and modified Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler models and referenced by Abaqus as
              | user-defined elements (UEL). At each displacement step, Abaqus provides framing and
              | sheathing node displacements to the subroutine and receives force and tangent stiffness
              | information back. When changing the mesh size of the sheathing and framing, the
              | spacing of the fasteners also changes since the fasteners must coincide with these nodes.
              | For the models employed, the strength and stiffness parameters of each fastener were
              | scaled for the mesh size used. The scale factor that the strength and stiffness terms for
              | each fastener were multiplied by is the mesh size divided by the fastener spacing at the
              | given location in the wall.

text          | Wall models were built to represent the small-scale tested wall specimens described in

              | x 1.22 m (4 ft x 4 ft) walls. One wood framed model was built with 41 mm (1-5/8 in)
              | coarse threaded screws, one with enhanced screws, and one with adhesive in addition to
              | the screw fasteners. One cold-formed steel framed model was built with 41 mm fine
              | threaded screws and another was modeled with adhesive in addition to these screws.

              | screw fasteners.

text          | CSUS walls had T-shaped returns, with returns extending 0.61 m (2 ft) from either side
              | of the major wall centerline. The tested stucco wall included L-returns on each end,
              | where only one side of the return was represented. The presence of returns was found to
              | significantly affect the stiffness and hysteretic behavior of the walls in racking as
              | previously described in Section 4.3.5. The presence of T-shaped end returns increased
              | initial stiffness by about 50% in a 2.4 m square wall and provided more strength in the
              | post-peak region of the loading hysteresis. The end returns also created a wall with
              | increased ductility at large deformations and a more highly pinched hysteresis. It was
              | hypothesized that this increased stiffness was provided the by the increased bending
              | resistance provided by the addition of material at the wall end studs as well as increased
              | uplift resistance provided by additional hold-down devices in the return walls. For
              | modeling purposes, the end studs in the major walls were fixed to the adjacent studs of
              | the return wall. This could be analogous to rigid screw connections between the members
              | forcing them to experience identical deformation. This connection engages the return
              | wall and the holdown springs which are installed along the return wall. Figure 5.14 shows
              | the representation of wall end returns in the finite element wall models built using
              | Abaqus. A modeled 1.2 m square gypsum board shear wall with adhesive includes about
              | 700 nodes and about 700 finite elements. A reduced number of nodes and elements can
              | be provided by reducing the mesh or fastener spacing.

title         | 5.2.6 Model validation with small scale gypsum wall tests
text          | The ultimate strength and secant stiffness measured at 0.1% wall drift for each wall is
              | shown in Table 5.6. Properties for the tested walls and finite element models are
              | compared. The wall strengths predicted by the finite element models are within 20% of
              | those observed in tests and three of the five wall models predicted strength within 6% of
              | the observed values during testing. Initial racking secant stiffness in the wall models was
              | up to 42% different from that observed in testing, with most analytical models exhibiting
              | somewhat lower initial stiffness than what was recorded from tests. The experimental
              | setup was bounded by horizontal steel members at the top and the bottom of the walls
              | that did not allow for much rotation of the sheathing panels. This was not considered in
              | the models and could be a reason that the test specimens showed somewhat stiffer
              | behavior than the models predicted in several cases. An underestimation of the elastic
              | stiffness of the gypsum could also have contributed, since referenced test values vary
              | substantially (Ali and Grimer 1969; Cramer et al. 2003).

text          | energy dissipation curves show that the walls with adhesive initially dissipate more
              | energy than those without, but the rate of dissipation reduces after the bond between the
              | gypsum and the paper has broken. While the adhesive walls show a more linear elastic
              | stiffness than walls with screws alone, the energy dissipated is still larger for adhesive
              | walls at these cycles because of the drastically larger forces reached. The finite element
              | models captured the general trends of the energy dissipation curves seen during testing,
              | though there are some differences. Notably, the models underestimated the rate of energy
              | dissipation in the adhesive walls at small deformations. This occurred because the
              | adhesive model assumes the fasteners are perfectly elastic at small deformations, while
              | there is some inelasticity in the adhesive fasteners even at small levels of deformation.

text          | Figure 5.19 shows the secant stiffness observed in leading loading cycles for walls
              | framed with wood and cold-formed steel. Both experimental data and finite element
              | results are shown. For both the conventional walls and those sheathed using adhesives,
              | the initial stiffness in the first loading cycle is larger in tests than the model predictions.
              | For the cold-formed steel framed wall utilizing screws only, the model secant stiffness
              | was about 20% smaller than that from testing throughout the loading history. This
              | difference can be explained by the slightly higher forces seen in the cyclic envelope curve
              | for the tested specimens when compared to the analysis results. For the adhesive walls,
              | the models predict only slightly degrading stiffness until the glued between the gypsum
              | and paper breaks (~0.3% drift), while the tested specimens show a more constant
              | stiffness degradation through this drift region. Again, this occurs because the adhesive
              | model assumes nearly elastic response until the fastener strength is reached.
              | Incorporating a small amount of strength and stiffness degradation into the adhesive
              | model would produce models in which the rate of energy dissipation and stiffness
              | degradation in early cycles better matches that seen in experimental results.

              | coinciding with these drift levels can be seen by comparing to Figure 5.16b. Figure 5.20a
              | shows the stresses in the wall with adhesive as the wall strength is reached. At this drift
              | level, large stresses are focused at the base of the wall, most prominently between the
              | center two studs. A concentration of stress around the hold-down on the tension side of
              | the wall is seen as the sheathing is required to transfer some of the load from the end stud
              | to the sill plate due to the flexibility of the hold-down. Stresses in the sheathing well after
              | the perimeter adhesive fastener connections have been broken are shown in Figure 5.20b.
              | At this level of deformation, areas of low stress along the wall perimeter indicate areas
              | where the adhesive and screw fasteners have failed. A large area of low stress is seen
              | near the tensile hold-down. This stress pattern indicates that as peak loading was reached,
              | the adhesive fasteners along the bottom of the wall failed, beginning near the hold-down
              | that was acting in tension. Even at this large level of racking drift, larger stresses are
              | shown between the interior studs toward the base of the wall, indicating that many
              | adhesive fasteners in that region are still intact. The stress diagrams for the walls with
              | screw fasteners show a similar pattern of increased stresses across the gypsum until screw
              | strength was reached. While observations from these stresses can help to locate regions in
              | which failure might initiate and propagate, individual fastener model behavior must be

text          | The force-displacement behavior of two gypsum-to-framing fasteners within the wall at
              | different locations is shown in Figure 5.21 at a cyclic drift level of 0.33%. One screw
              | fastener and a 178 mm length of adhesive in parallel are represented by the loading
              | curves. The forces and displacements are measured along the trajectory of initial fastener
              | deformation. At peak loading of the wall, the fastener at the base corner has just
              | surpassed its strength and has shed a large percentage of its peak load. At this same drift
              | level, a fastener on the field of the wall has only experienced deformations less than one-
              | sixth those seen at the wall corner connection and is showing nearly elastic behavior.
              | This illustration shows that many sheathing-to-framing fasteners contribute to wall
              | behavior and that fastener type, spacing, and wall geometry all contribute to the racking
              | behavior of light-frame walls. Explicitly modeling screw and adhesive fasteners within
              | walls is necessary to understand the effect of connectors with different hysteretic
              | behaviors and spacings and explains why the use of adhesive is so effective in
              | significantly increasing the strength and stiffness of the walls.

text          | To examine the effects of different modeling assumptions and determine if any
              | simplification in these wall finite element models could be made, some parameter and
              | component properties were changed and the effects on wall performance studied. Figure

text          | sheathing-to-framing fasteners. This figure illustrates that if the hysteretic spring pairs
              | representing each fastener were not rotated to align with the initial trajectory of each
              | fastener, the wall racking strength predicted by the model would be significantly larger
              | (about 13%). Similarly, if only one oriented spring were used, the strength would be
              | smaller (about 7%) and the reduction in wall racking stiffness after peak strength was
              | reached would be much more abrupt. The use of one oriented spring is only possible with
              | monotonic model loading, as stability in reverse loading requires spring pairs. The initial
              | stiffness of walls built with different fastener orientations is similar since initial fastener
              | stiffness is the same regardless of spring orientation. Figure 5.22b shows the effect of
              | altering the sheathing mesh size on wall behavior. While altering the mesh size does not
              | affect the initial stiffness nor drastically change wall strength, the walls with finer meshes
              | tended to produce walls with slightly reduced peak strengths. This occurs because as the
              | mesh size is reduced, so is the spacing of sheathing-to-framing fastener elements. While
              | the strength and stiffness parameters of each fastener are scaled for the new spacing, the
              | strength of the wall reduces because each fastener spring pair can be better oriented to the
              | direction of initial deformation as the mesh size reduces and more discrete fasteners are
              | produced. While approximate orientation is important to capturing the wall behavior, the
              | precise orientation is not necessary. Approximating the initial trajectory of each fastener
              | within 10 degrees or so is sufficient to accurately capture wall performance.

text          | Figure 5.23a compares the monotonic force-displacement curves for adhesive wood
              | framed walls when either the framing or gypsum panels are assumed to be rigid. The
              | default mechanical properties used in the models are shown in Table 5.5. Assuming fully
              | rigid framing significantly increases wall racking strength and initial stiffness, and it
              | provides a more ductile response than when the realistic framing member stiffness is
              | used. This increase in strength and stiffness occurs because the rigid studs do not bend
              | and individual fasteners must undergo larger deformations at similar drift levels to bridge
              | between the framing and sheathing nodes. Assuming the sheathing panels are rigid
              | increases the wall racking strength only slightly, but significantly increases racking
              | stiffness. This effect on wall stiffness is especially prominent for walls where adhesive is
              | used because the sheathing-to-framing fasteners are stiff and the forces resisted by the
              | sheathing become much larger than when screw fasteners only are used. The effect of
              | varying hold-down stiffness is shown in Figure 5.23b. While the hold-downs used were
              | much larger than required, providing rigid uplift restraint to the end studs further
              | increased wall racking strength and stiffness in the model. Using hold-downs with half of
              | the stiffness of those used in testing provided reduced wall model strength and stiffness
              | and the ultimate load was reached at a larger racking displacement. These walls are
              | sensitive to hold-down stiffness since any uplift in the end studs translates into roughly
              | similar racking displacement for square walls. For wall with larger height-to-width ratios
              | (aspect ratios), the effect of hold-down stiffness on the lateral stiffness of walls is even
              | more pronounced. These observations are important since many light-frame wall models
              | assume rigid framing members and rigid hold-down conditions. For strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced light-frame walls, these assumptions may lead to un-conservatively
              | large predicted resistances. The effect of all of the described model alterations is
              | summarized in Table 5.7.

              | provided an additional opportunity to validate and calibrate the proposed finite element

              | example, specimens W2, W3, and W4 were not modeled because the flexibility of the

text          | In the previous section, the development and calibration of models for screw and
              | adhesive gypsum-to-framing fasteners was discussed. For these larger wall specimens,
              | additional components were used in experimentation that were not present in the small
              | scale walls tested. Gypsum panel joint connections, screw stucco fasteners, and wall end
              | returns were used in the tested full-scale wall specimens. None of these components were
              | modeled for the small scale gypsum walls tested at Stanford, so the test data from the
              | CSUS tests presents an opportunity for further validating the proposed finite element

blank         | 
text          | For these tested walls, the parameters for some of the light-frame fastener components
              | were adjusted. It was found that fasteners in the large wall specimens lost strength at
              | smaller levels of deformation than was observed in connection testing. This is
              | hypothesized to have occurred because at large levels of wall deformation, the gypsum
              | panels separate from the framing members by pulling over the heads of the screw
              | fasteners. This failure mechanism was not observed in the fastener tests because the
              | connection of the gypsum at the panel edges inhibited gypsum-framing separation.
              | Similarly, in the small-scale framed wall specimens, the gypsum panels were somewhat
              | restricted from separating from the framing members because the steel channels above
              | and below the tested walls pinched the gypsum panels in place at large racking drifts. For
              | the full-scale walls, no boundary elements restricted the movement of gypsum panels,
              | allowing for panel separation from the framing at large drift ratios. Through inspecting

text          | The cumulative hysteretic energy dissipation for wall W1 is shown in Figure 5.26. The

              | dissipated more energy than the finite element wall throughout the cyclic protocol. This
              | under-estimation of the energy dissipation occurred because the force of the model cyclic
              | envelope curve is slightly less than that of the tested wall for most displacement ranges.

text          | For this specimen, the uplift at the wall end studs was measured during testing. Figure
              | 5.27 shows the relationship of wall drift versus hold-down uplift for the two ends of the
              | wall from testing and finite element analysis. The wall uplift observed during testing was
              | much larger than that predicted using analytic methods. This likely occurred because the
              | wall uplift was being measured on the outside edge of the wall stud, away from the hold-
              | down devices. It was noted in Section 4.3.3, that before the testing of specimen W6, the
              | end studs were free to rotate around the threaded rod in the hold-down device, which was
              | installed inside of the wall. The distance between the approximate point of hold-down
              | rotation and the point of measurement of uplift was approximately 100 mm. So at a
              | racking drift of 2.5%, a significant portion of this measured displacement was not due to
              | holdown uplift, but rather to holdown rotation. Since the finite element model uses linear
              | beam-column elements and not brick elements to model the framing members, the
              | rotation of the studs around the hold-down location due to hold-down eccentricity could
              | not be captured in the model.

              | and around the end studs on the bottom half of the wall. The stresses are small at these

text          | The cumulative energy dissipation from specimen W6 can be seen in Figure 5.31 from

              | are quite similar, with the model underestimating the rate of energy dissipation at small

              | strength at a drift of 0.3%. At this level, high stresses are seen focused at the base of the
              | wall near the hold-downs. Compared to the wall without adhesive (W1), the stresses are
              | much larger and more evenly distributed at peak loading. The highest concentration of
              | stresses is seen at the base of the wall on the compression side. At this drift level, the

              | much smaller than those seen during peak loading. The stresses in the gypsum at the
              | bottom of the wall are particularly small, indicating failure of the adhesive connection at

              | location where the adhesive bonds have broken on the bottom half of the wall. At this
              | level (about half-way up the bottom panel of gypsum), the adhesive is still intact and
              | resisting large loads. At higher drift levels, this stress band moves up the wall as the

              | case because as the wall racks against the end returns, the gypsum panels at the base of

              | modeling procedure described was used to build full-height wall models of varying wall
              | lengths. For this study, a series of walls ranging from 0.4 m (16 in) to 7.1 m (24 ft) were
              | modeled using finite element approach discussed in this chapter. All walls were 2.4 m (8
              | ft) in height. Both adhesive-enhanced interior gypsum walls and strengthened and
              | stiffened exterior stucco-gypsum walls were modeled. All walls included nominal 76 mm
              | x 102 mm (3 in by 4 in) sill plate members as well as double end studs and blocking
              | along the horizontal centerline of the wall. All sheathing was placed horizontally,
              | staggering vertical sheathing joints. Screw adhesive-to-framing fasteners were applied to
              | the edge of sheathing members at a spacing of 178 mm, while a field spacing of 305 mm
              | was used. When adhesive connections were used in the models, the strength and stiffness
              | of the adhesive elements were adjusted for the contact area of the adhesive along each
              | member. This means that the adhesive connectors were stronger and stiffer along the sill
              | plate, where the contact area was larger, when compared to intermediate stud members
              | where framing members were smaller. For walls modeled with exterior stucco, the stucco
              | fasteners were placed at 102 mm on center along the perimeter of the wall, while a
              | spacing of 178 mm was used in the field. For this analysis, only walls without end returns
              | were considered. The hold-down stiffness provided is that of a commonly-used hold-
              | down device, 12.5 kN/mm (71.2 kips/in). Shear anchors were included along the sill plate
              | at a spacing of 406 mm with the first anchor being installed 203 mm from each wall end.

              | lengths are shown in Figure 5.56. The comparable curves for enhanced stucco-gypsum

              | conditions, the unit strength remains fairly constant despite the length and aspect ratio of
              | the wall. However, the unit stiffness varies drastically depending on the wall length.
              | Walls with high aspect ratios (i.e., small length) show unit stiffnesses much smaller than
              | that of longer walls. At continuous wall lengths exceeding about 4 m, the unit wall
              | stiffness becomes fairly constant. This decreased wall unit stiffness for short walls occurs
              | because the bending stiffness is considerably smaller for high-aspect walls. In addition,

              | of the shear anchor, the sill plate was modeled as pinned to the ground. Though no hold-
              | down device was modeled in these simulated walls, stud uplift was resisted by adhesive
              | sheathing-to-framing connections and the shear anchors provided a few inches away from
              | the end stud members, though this uplift transfer mechanism is significantly more
              | flexible than the condition where a hold-down device is provided.
blank         | 
text          | The effect of these varying uplift constraints on the strength and stiffness of adhesive-
              | enhanced gypsum and stucco-gypsum walls is shown in Figure 5.58 and Figure 5.59.
              | Walls modeled with rigid hold-downs are shown to only provide marginally higher
              | racking strength than walls with conventional wall hold-down stiffnesses. However, the
              | strength of the enhanced walls is greatly reduced when no end stud uplift restraint is
              | provided. The importance of uplift restraint in providing wall racking strength increases
              | as the wall aspect ratio increases (length decreases). For solid walls exceeding 5 m in
              | length, the absence of hold-downs at the wall ends only reduces peak racking strength by
              | about 30%, while omitting hold-downs from walls less than 1.2 meters in length causes a
              | reduction of more than 80% in racking strength. Comparing the strength measurements
              | from models of enhanced gypsum and stucco-gypsum walls, providing rigid wall
              | restraints appears to have more of an influence on the strength of adhesive gypsum walls
              | than enhanced adhesive-gypsum walls. This occurs because for enhanced adhesive walls,
              | the strength reduces drastically after the peak force is reached, while enhanced stucco
              | walls show significantly larger displacement ductility.
blank         | 
text          | The initial wall stiffness is also influenced by the hold-down restraint. Providing rigid
              | vertical end stud restraint increases racking stiffness anywhere from 10% to 100%, when
              | compared to walls with conventional hold-downs. Providing no uplift restraint reduces
              | initial wall racking stiffness by 10 to 70%. The stiffness of the vertical end stud restraints
              | was found to more drastically influence the racking stiffness of walls with high aspect
              | ratios (narrow walls).

text          | Design procedures for conventional light-frame walls require hold-downs at wall ends to

              | instructions for the treatment of walls with openings, the appropriateness of these

              | differences in behavior between conventional and strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-
              | frame walls. While the tests performed on strength- and stiffness-enhanced gypsum and
              | stucco walls at CSUS included some walls with openings, other variables were also
              | present in those specimens such as the use of wall end returns. Also, the only opening
              | configuration investigated was a door opening placed at a constant distance from the edge
              | of the tested wall panel. In order to more fully understand the effects of openings on wall
              | strength and stiffness, a series of seven walls were created using high fidelity finite
              | element models in Abaqus. Both exterior walls with stucco and gypsum and interior

              | double end studs and double studs around openings. Adhesive was placed along each
              | framing member, while stucco and gypsum screws were utilized only along the member
              | closest to the wall edge or opening when double members were used. Horizontal blocking
              | was modeled at the mid-height of the walls between sheathing panels. The stiffness of

text          | These walls were again modeled, but hold-down device elements were removed at
              | interior studs adjacent to wall openings. The calculated strength and stiffness capacity
              | ratios are shown in Figure 5.62 along with the prediction of Equation 4.1. The strength
              | values found when no hold-downs were included around wall openings are much smaller
              | than those found when restraints were placed around every wall opening. This time, the

              | for strength. This makes sense given the observation that the lack of uplift resistance in

text          | While the strength correction factors to take into account the effect of openings proposed
              | by Sugiyama has been shown to be conservative for conventional wood and cold-formed
              | steel framed walls even when intermediate hold-down restraints are not provided (Heine
              | 1997; Salenikovich et al. 2000), these finding show that the strength prediction may be
              | un-conservative for perforated strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame walls. This
              | may be the case for several reasons. First, many of the tests performed to validate
              | Equation 4.1 for conventional construction included very long shear walls (12.2 m), with
              | the narrowest wall piers being about 1.2 m in width. This study involves walls that are
              | only 4.9 m long, with full-height piers as narrow as 0.3 m in some instances. It has
              | already been shown that narrow wall piers result in larger unit strength and stiffness
              | reductions for segments without hold-downs, when compared to those including hold-
              | downs. Also, in conventional walls, the strength of wall segments is sustained over a
              | large range of racking drifts. But for adhesive-enhanced light-frame walls, the strengths
              | of wall segments are reached at varying drift levels, with strength dropping rapidly after
              | strength is reached in each segment. This means that while it may be safe to assume the
              | strength of conventional walls is equal to the cumulative strength of wall segments, this
              | could lead to un-conservative estimates when considering strength- and stiffness-
              | enhanced systems. In conventional light-frame design, using a segmented shear wall
              | design approach in which the strength contribution of each full-height wall segment is
              | considered is common.

title         | 5.2.12 Summary
blank         | 
text          | A high fidelity finite element modeling strategy for strength- and stiffness-enhanced
              | light-frame gypsum and stucco walls was developed. The finite element software Abaqus
              | was used to model each important component of light-frame walls within a wall system.
              | Framing members were represented with elastic beam-column elements, sheathing panels
              | were modeled as elastic shell plane stress elements, and sheathing-to-framing fastener
              | and inter-panel connections were modeled using nonlinear hysteretic spring pairs with
              | behavior fit to component test data. Hold-down restraint and wall end returns were also
              | explicitly simulated. Overall, this modeling approach was found to accurately capture the
              | behavior of conventional and enhanced light-frame gypsum and stucco walls when model
              | results were compared to test data. The strength, stiffness, and hysteretic shape were well
              | replicated in most cases. While this finite element approach was found to capture the
              | increased stiffness and ductility in enhanced light-frame walls with end returns, the
              | change in hysteretic shape produced when wall end returns were included was not
              | replicated precisely. This is due to damage to framing and sheathing members that was
              | not modeled in the finite element models due to a lack of component test data. Despite
              | this short-coming, the developed finite element wall modeling procedure was found to
              | capture the behavior of strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame walls with a good
              | degree of accuracy, especially for cases where T-shaped end returns are not utilized.

text          | Strength- and stiffness-enhanced walls with differing lengths, opening patterns, and hold-
              | down configurations were also modeled to study the effects of theses parameters on wall
              | performance. It was found that while wall segments of all lengths showed similar unit
              | strength as long as wall uplift restraint was provided, unit wall stiffness per unit length
              | was very sensitive to wall length. The use of hold-down devices was found to greatly
              | impact both strength and stiffness for narrow wall segments, while longer walls were less
              | affected. The strength and stiffness of enhanced walls were found to be sensitive to the
              | presence of wall openings, perhaps more-so than conventional light-frame walls because
              | of the limited-ductility nature of individual wall piers.

text          | Finite element models were able to replicate experimental wall strengths with an error of
              | less than 20% in all cases. Initial racking stiffness in the model walls was less accurate,
              | with model stiffness underestimating the observed stiffness in most cases. This
              | underestimate of stiffness, however, could be due to more restrictive boundary conditions
              | on the sheathing during testing that were not included in the finite element model. On
              | average, the strength and initial stiffness of the modeled finite element walls varied from
              | the experimental values by less than 10%.
blank         | 
text          | For the gypsum walls utilizing both screw fasteners and adhesive, the finite element
              | models displayed a smaller rate of energy dissipation compared to the test walls at small
              | displacement cycles. Additionally, the in-plane wall stiffness of the adhesive models
              | remained fairly constant until the adhesive in the walls fractured. In the test specimens,
              | the secant stiffness degraded gradually. This occurred because the adhesive elements
              | used remained nearly elastic at small deformations. Implementing this degradation in the
              | model could lead to model stiffnesses and rates of hysteretic energy dissipation that more
              | closely mirror the experimental results.

text          | Inspecting the distribution of stresses within the elastic model sheathing panels was found
              | to provide a way to trace damage initiation and progression within the wall specimens. In
              | all of the specimens modeled, large sheathing stresses formed at the base of the wall as
              | the peak strength of sheathing-to-framing fasteners was reached. Stress concentrations
              | were also observed near hold-downs in tension as the sheathing panels were required to
              | carry some loads from the end stud to the sill plate due to the stiff load path created by
              | adhesive gypsum-to-framing connections. After peak strength was reached, stress was
              | shed beginning at the sill plate and progressing to the end studs, indicating a loss of
              | strength of the fasteners and damage at these locations.

text          | Altering the initial sheathing-to-framing element orientation, wall mesh size, sheathing
              | and framing mechanical properties and hold-down stiffness were all found to alter the

text          | The high fidelity modeling strategy developed herein is flexible and may be implemented
              | for conventional and enhanced light-frame walls of varying geometries. The approach,
              | however, does have some limitations. Since sheathing members are assumed to be elastic,
              | cracking of the panels is not simulated and breaks in sheathing members must be
              | provided in areas where early gypsum cracking is anticipated. Additionally, stud and
              | plate splitting in wood framing which has been observed at large wall deformations
              | (Dinehart and Shenton 1998) are not simulated due to the use of elastic beam-column
              | elements to represent framing members. For a similar reason, framing member local
              | buckling for walls built with cold-formed steel framing is not simulated, though this

text          | Detailed finite element models have been shown to fairly accurately capture the behavior
              | of tested strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame walls. However, these models often

title         | 5.3.1 Introduction
blank         | 
text          | Following the approach used by other researchers for the modeling of conventional wood
              | and cold-formed steel framed construction (Kasal et al. 1994; Folz and Filiatrault 2001),
              | enhanced light-frame structures can be modeled by using single nonlinear elements to
              | represent individual walls. The configuration of one of these equivalent diagonal wall
              | elements is shown in Figure 5.63. Pinned beam-column elements are used at wall
              | boundaries as columns and beams. The lateral resistance of the walls is provided by
              | hysteretic springs, with one or two equivalent diagonal elements representing an entire
              | wall or a wall segment. Though only one element is shown in the figure, two elements
              | could be used that cross each other in order to more evenly distribute vertical and shear
              | forces between the floor nodes above and below the walls. The behavior of the hysteretic
              | equivalent diagonal element is phenomenological and based on the observed behavior of
              | strength- and stiffness-enhanced walls from testing or detailed finite element analysis.
              | Using this configuration, geometric nonlinearities may be accounted for in the model by
              | providing axial load in proportion to the gravity load to the columns around each wall or
              | wall segment. While this model provides shear and vertical forces to much fewer nodes
              | than would be affected with a more detailed analysis, the model may be discretized
              | further into wall segments to estimate the shear and vertical forces at specific points
              | within a wall. The hysteretic equivalent diagonal wall springs incorporate stiffness
              | contributions from wall shear, bending, and uplift, so hold-down springs do not need to
              | be modeled under the column elements to capture the effect of stud uplift. For these
              | models, the out-of-plane resistance of walls is not modeled. The program Open System
              | for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees, Mazzoni et al. 2006) was used for
              | these analyses, as the model includes a library of already-built uniaxial materials that can
              | adequately capture the hysteretic behavior of light-frame strength- and stiffness-enhanced
              | walls.

text          | The force-displacement behavior of the conventional gypsum wood framed wall tested
              | (W1) at CSUS is shown in Figure 5.64 along with the fitted equivalent diagonal element
              | model behavior. For walls with conventional dowel fasteners only, the 10-parameter
              | CUREE model (Folz and Filiatrault 2001) was utilized to represent the behavior of wall
              | elements. As with the components used for detailed wall analysis, the parameters for the
              | model backbone were fit visually by comparing to the test data. The hysteretic parameters
              | were fit by altering the parameters until a minimum was found in the combined hysteretic
              | force and energy dissipation error between the model and test behavior. The general
              | hysteretic shape was captured well by the equivalent diagonal element, though more
              | variation in the force reloading stiffness is seen in the tested wall than for the model wall.
              | Since the general hysteretic shape and energy dissipation in the model matches that of the
              | tested wall well, this discrepancy is not believed to provide a major source of model
              | error.

text          | To capture the behavior of wood framed gypsum walls built with both screw fasteners
              | and a construction adhesive (specimen W6), two equivalent diagonal element spring
              | models were employed in parallel. One model accounts for the behavioral contribution of
              | the screw fasteners, while the other mimics the behavior of the adhesive connections. The
              | contribution of the screw fasteners was again represented using the CUREE model, while
              | the adhesive was represented using the modified Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler peak-
              | oriented model (Ibarra et al. 2005). The model parameters were fit in a similar manner as
              | was used for the wall with screw fasteners alone. The hysteretic racking behavior of
              | specimen W6 is shown in Figure 5.66 along with the fitted equivalent diagonal element
              | behavior. The two behavioral models in parallel appear to capture the performance of the
              | tested enhanced light-frame wall quite well. The strength, initial stiffness, and hysteretic
              | shape are all well replicated by this model. The tested wall shows more gradual strength
              | and stiffness degradation under reloading cycles than the equivalent diagonal element
              | wall model, though these differences are small.

blank         | 
text          | Finally, the stucco-gypsum exterior wall tested at CSUS was modeled using two CUREE
              | models in parallel. The reason two models were used is to provide post-capping residual
              | resistance in the wall. The CUREE model provides a linear post-capping stiffness,
              | meaning that if the cyclic envelope curve observed in testing includes a non-constant
              | post-capping stiffness, models in parallel must be used to provide reserve wall strength at
              | large drifts. The hysteretic force-displacement racking curve for the wall models in series
              | along with the hysteresis of the tested enhanced stucco-gypsum wall are shown in Figure
              | 5.70. The uniaxial model is shown to capture the behavior of the wall quite well, with the
              | initial stiffness, racking strength, and ductility replicated with a reasonable degree of
              | accuracy. One observed difference in the hysteretic behavior is that the model assumes a
              | bi-linear unloading curve whereas the tested wall displays an unloading stiffness that
              | gradually decreases. While this could affect to what degree the wall self-centers after
              | loading and therefore affect the estimation of ratcheting behavior and residual
              | displacement, overall the element was found to reproduce the desired wall behavior

text          | Since the CUREE and modified Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler model parameters provided in
              | this section are for models fit to 2.4 m square walls, walls of differing dimensions and
              | aspect ratios will display different responses. Perhaps the most important difference in
              | response for walls of differing length involves the initial racking stiffness. In Chapter 6,
              | an equation for the stiffness of enhanced light-frame walls is presented for design
              | purposes (Equation 6.14). Using the stiffness given in this equation, scale factors can be
              | computed and applied to strength, stiffness, and displacement terms of the spring
              | parameters developed for continuous 2.4 m square walls. To calculate the scale factor
              | which can be applied to the stiffness parameters of the equivalent diagonal element
              | models, a realistic initial stiffness of the wall to be modeled must be calculated according
              | to Equation 6.14. The stiffness of a comparable 2.4 m square wall can be calculated using

text          | A modeling procedure for enhanced light-frame walls was developed which uses
              | hysteretic equivalent diagonal elements to model the behavior of complete walls or wall
              | segments. These wall models are appropriate for full building models where NLRHA and
              | IDA will be performed. In these circumstances, the computational expense required for
              | high-fidelity finite element models to find a solution is too great to perform analyses
              | quickly. The CUREE and modified Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler models were used to
              | capture the cyclic behavior observed in light-frame wall specimens for the equivalent
              | diagonal elements. Parameters were fit for 2.4 m square wood framed walls with
              | conventional gypsum sheathing and adhesive enhancement as well as an enhanced stucco
              | wall. Model parameters for a strength- and stiffness-enhanced gypsum shear wall using
              | cold-formed steel framing were also fit. A procedure for altering the model parameters
              | given for walls of varying lengths and with openings was described. It was found that the
              | adjustments for wall length led to element performance that matched that predicted using
              | detailed finite element models well. The strength, stiffness, and displacement adjustment
              | factors for walls with openings were shown to provide equivalent diagonal element
              | behavior that matched that of detailed finite element models quite well, except for cases
              | where many openings were present. In walls with plentiful openings, the recommended
              | macro-element parameter scale factors tended to under-estimate wall racking stiffness.

text          | Though these parameter adjustments may be useful in many cases, if precise macro-
              | element behavior is required for walls with openings, it is recommended that the wall be
              | modeled first using a detailed finite element analysis procedure. The equivalent diagonal
              | element model can then be adjusted to match the behavior of the more detailed model.
              | While these equivalent diagonal element models are effective in creating structural
              | representations that can be analyzed with ease, they do have some limitations. These
              | models cannot capture some local component behavior, flexural behavior of framing
              | members, and kinematic behavior at large deformations when openings are present.
              | Additionally, specific boundary conditions in the wall are assumed (e.g., hold-down and
              | shear anchor patterns) in wall models. In cases where the modeled wall boundary
              | conditions within an equivalent diagonal model are substantially different than those
              | initially assumed, detailed finite element analysis of individual walls must be carried and
              | the equivalent diagonal spring behavior fit to this new data.

blank         | 
text          | While developing detailed finite element and equivalent diagonal element models may be
              | feasible modeling procedures for those in research fields, these approaches would likely
              | not be used by those in the design industry due to the modeling and computational time
              | required as well as the lack of a user-friendly graphical user interface in model
              | composition. In this section, a procedure for modeling strength- and stiffness-enhanced
              | light-frame walls using a readily available structural analysis software (ETABS,
              | Habibullah 1997) is presented. The modeling procedure is only applicable to walls that
              | are in the elastic range as no nonlinear behavior is considered in the model elements. This

text          | approach makes sense for strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures since
              | they are designed to remain nearly elastic under the design earthquake. Building analysis
              | can be performed at this seismic level and provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the
              | deformations and forces expected to be seen in enhanced light-frame structures at seismic
              | levels up to the design earthquake. These models are easy to build in three-dimensions

text          | While light-frame walls loaded laterally display a complicated load path where forces are
              | shared between framing members, sheathing, inter-component fasteners, and boundary
              | elements, the racking behavior of these walls can be approximated by the use of elastic
              | shell elements. The software ETABS, along with many others, includes elements that are
              | appropriate for the modeling of enhanced light-frame walls. In ETABS, the walls are
              | modeled as “shell” elements. This software also includes a “membrane” element which
              | provides only in-plane stiffness, while the “plate” member only considers out-of-plane
              | stiffness. The “shell” element includes both in-plane and out-of-plane stiffness and

              | is Poisson’s ratio, and t is the thickness of the homogenous wall. For the enhanced
              | gypsum walls, the modulus of elasticity was set to 1.7 GPa (250 ksi) based on values
              | found for gypsum wallboard panels during testing (Cramer et al. 2003; Gypsum
              | Association 2010). The thickness of the shell was set as the combined thickness of the
              | two sides of gypsum, 31.8 mm (1.25 in). After setting these values, the in-plane stiffness
              | of walls of varying lengths was calculated using Equations 5.13 and 5.14. The stiffness
              | calculated over a variety of wall lengths were not found to correlate well with the results
              | of finite element wall modeling when these parameters were used. ETABS includes an
              | option to apply stiffness modification factors to shell elements. These factors are scale
              | factors to be applied to the shear and bending stiffness of the shell elements in-plane. To

              | found that the bending stiffness of the wall should be increased while the shear stiffness
              | should be decreased. The bending stiffness was scaled by a factor of 2.59 and the shear
              | stiffness was scaled by 0.62 for the adhesive-enhanced wood framed gypsum walls. The
              | use of these parameters to modify the stiffness of the material in ETABS is shown in the
              | menu replicated from the program in Figure 5.75. Since the stiffness contribution from

              | which the stiffness of these shell elements is being matched, the shell elements are
              | considered pinned at the base. The wall models were discretized into a mesh of about 150
              | mm square (6 in) shell elements. The discretization was found to affect the wall model
              | results somewhat, especially if large mesh sizes (> 300 mm) were used.

title         | 5.4.4 Summary
blank         | 
text          | A method for creating elastic models for enhanced light-frame walls using the structural
              | analysis software ETABS was presented. This modeling technique is appropriate for
              | analyzing strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures under the design level
              | and smaller ground motions, as these structures are designed to remain nearly elastic
              | under these hazard levels. This modeling approach can be completed with ease for most
              | structures by design engineers and captures many of the 3D building effects that are
              | critical in light-frame structures. Light-frame walls were modeled using shell elements.
              | After assigning the mechanical properties of the sheathing materials to the shell elements,
              | stiffness modifiers were applied to replicate the varied unit stiffness of light-frame walls
              | as a function of length that was observed in testing and detailed finite element analysis
              | results. Modeling openings within these wall models was found to over-predict wall
              | racking stiffness when compared to more detailed finite element models. When the wall
              | segments above and below openings were removed in the elastic shell models, the
              | stiffness matched those from detailed finite element modeling quite well when few
              | openings were present, while underestimating the wall racking stiffness for walls with
              | more plentiful openings. Because limiting seismic deformations is the goal of enhanced
              | light-frame structures, slightly underestimating racking stiffness is preferable to
              | overestimating. Therefore elastic shell element models of light-framed walls should
              | incorporate only full-height wall segments, neglecting the areas above and below wall
              | openings. The use of ETABS shell elements to model wall end returns was found to

title         | Design of light-frame strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced structures
text          | This chapter describes the formulation of a design procedure for enhanced light-frame
              | structures that leads to nearly-elastic structural performance under the design earthquake.
              | Before a design procedure could be determined, several preliminary steps were required.
              | The steps followed in this chapter are outlined in Figure 6.1. First, the enhanced gypsum
              | wallboard and stucco wall test data was analyzed to set nominal unit wall strengths to be
              | used for design. Data from experimentation and detailed finite element analysis was then
              | used to calibrate equations that that could be used to calculate the strength and stiffness
              | of enhanced light framed walls with different aspect ratios, opening patterns, and
              | anchorage conditions. Two separate design approaches were then developed, each with
              | the goal of providing near-elastic performance under the design earthquake. These design
              | methods include a modal analysis design procedure and a force-based design procedure.
              | The full design process is outlined in Figure 6.2. For either procedure, an elastic shell
              | element model (Section 5.4) may be developed to distribute the modal or force demands
              | to individual building components and reduce the number of required calculations. After
              | the formulation of the design procedure, the design of several enhanced archetype
              | buildings is described.

title         | 6.1 Background
text          | Many small traditional light-frame structures are designed based on prescriptive
              | requirements that do not involve structural analysis. For example, the International
              | Residential Code (ICC 2012) requires specific wall bracing layouts for wood and cold-

text          | formed steel structures depending on seismic exposure and building geometry; however
              | no design procedure that simulates the forces or deformations that may be imposed by an
              | earthquake is required. These prescriptive code requirements are intended for detached
              | homes two stories or less in height and townhouses three stories or less in height. For
              | light-frame buildings not meeting these requirements, the International Building Code
              | (IBC 2006) requirements would be used. While these prescriptive requirements have led
              | to a light-frame building stock that largely protects life safety, they do not provide a way
              | to assess the effects of seismic damage to light-frame structures. For example, the vast
              | majority of light-frame structures protected life-safety as intended during the 1994
              | Northridge Earthquake, yet large economic losses resulted and many residents were
              | displaced (Comerio 1997). A design procedure that addresses consequences of seismic
              | damage that are not just limited to life safety is desired.
blank         | 
text          | For light-frame structures in which the geometry or size will not allow for a completely
              | prescriptive design, force-based allowable stress design (ASD) or load and resistance
              | factor design (LRFD) is employed (AFPA 2008; AISI 2007) with seismic forces applied
              | to the structure conforming to an equivalent lateral force procedure (ASCE 2010).
              | Variability in design using this methodology occurs because there is no established
              | standard to distributing lateral structural loads to walls and diaphragms within light-frame
              | structures. Some engineers assume floor diaphragms are flexible, others will assume they
              | are rigid, while others may use engineering judgment to distribute the lateral loads at
              | each floor to individual components (NAHBRC 2000). In light-frame structures with
              | many walls, the method of lateral force distribution can lead to widely varying force and
              | deformation demands in individual elements. In an analysis of various lateral force
              | distribution procedures for wood construction, Kasal et al. (2004) noted that many of the
              | procedures attribute a large percentage of lateral loads to interior walls, which are often
              | not structurally connected to floor and ceiling diaphragms in conventional construction
              | and are usually more flexible than assumed. Additionally, IBC Code computed forces
              | (e.g., using R = 6.5) may have little to do with those that may actually act during strong
              | earthquakes. Both global and component forces may be very different than those
              | assumed.

text          | Aside from the variable methods of applying equivalent lateral seismic loads to light-
              | frame structures, most light-frame shear walls systems are designed to allow for large
              | inelasticities under the design earthquake that cannot be tolerated for enhanced light-
              | frame systems. Recently, several researchers have developed displacement-based design
              | procedures for light-frame structures (Priestley 1999; Filiatrault and Folz 2002) to
              | explicitly target an acceptable floor drift. However, these design procedures require
              | detailed information from the building system such as a pushover curve and estimated
              | equivalent viscous damping. Determining these parameters requires the development of a
              | numerical building model. The procedures also assume an equivalent linear lateral
              | stiffness that is dependent on the seismic hazard and expected deformations. Pang and
              | Rosowsky (2009) developed a displacement-based design procedure that does not require
              | a pushover analysis and uses simple modal analysis to determine required structural
              | stiffness and base shear required for design. Their analysis showed a reduction in the
              | probability of reaching most drift limit states using multiple building archetypes when
              | using the displacement-based design procedure described instead of conventional force-
              | based procedures. While these procedures have incorporated the consideration of seismic
              | drift limits in light-frame structures, the drifts and required base shears considered allow
              | for considerable inelastic behavior and drifts that would cause substantial damage to
              | light-frame structures. The equivalent stiffness and equivalent damping ratios used in
              | direct displacement based procedures (Priestley 1999; Filiatrault and Folz 2002; Pang and
              | Rosowsky 2009) remain highly controversial (Akkar and Miranda 2005; Miranda and
              | Ruiz-Garcia 2002). The suitability of these design methods for short period structures is
              | even more in question since these direct displacement methods typically assume a period-
              | independent relationship between equivalent period and ductility ratio and between
              | equivalent period and damping ratio (Lin and Miranda 2008; Kwan and Billington 2003)

text          | In order for strength- and stiffness- enhanced light-frame structures to be implemented in
              | practice, a new design methodology was developed. The procedure uses a modal analysis
              | approach on a lumped mass model to determine the required strength and stiffness on
              | each floor level to keep the building nearly elastic under the design earthquake. An
              | alternate equivalent lateral force procedure was also developed that achieves similar

text          | strength and stiffness requirements. Forces and deformations induced by the modal or
              | force procedure are distributed to each wall within the structure neglecting potential
              | torsional motion, making this simplified procedure appropriate for buildings where
              | torsional motions are minimal. In Appendix B, a modal analysis procedure that considers
              | torsion is described. Both design methods are straightforward and would not require the
              | use of numerical building modeling, though an elastic shell element model may be built
              | to limit required calculations.

text          | Though strength- and stiffness-enhancements may be provided to light-frame systems
              | using a variety of structural materials and components, this section will address only the
              | use of the components tested as described in Chapters 3 and 4. Thus, the design
              | methodology will focus on the use of stucco installed with strong screw fasteners and
              | gypsum wallboard (either conventional or paperless glass mat gypsum) attached with
              | standard construction adhesive and drywall screws. The composition of the shear walls
              | will be limited to those shown in Table 6.1 for wood framed walls and Table 6.2 for cold-
              | formed steel framed walls. Other enhanced wall configurations and materials could be
              | used, but wall testing and detailed finite element analysis would be required to
              | characterize the performance of those components before design implementation.

text          | To implement a design procedure for light-frame strength- and stiffness-enhanced
              | structures, the behavior of enhanced walls must be defined. In this section, methods for
              | calculating the lateral strength and stiffness of enhanced light-frame walls of different
              | geometries are presented. Both data from wall testing and detailed finite element models

text          | The strength and stiffness values to be used for the design of enhanced light-frame
              | structures are based on experimental results of 2.4 m and 4.9 m long full-height wood and
              | cold-formed steel walls (Hopkins et al. 2014) and a series of enhanced room enclosure
              | tests performed at the Network for Earthquake Engineering (NEES) facility at the
              | University of California, Berkeley (Acevedo et al. 2014). These experiments explored the
              | behavior of light-frame walls with both enhanced gypsum and stucco details. Wall
              | opening patterns, wall hold-down configurations, and wall end return configurations were
              | varied to observe the effect of these factors on wall behavior. While ASTM standards
              | generally require the testing of at least two nominally identical walls to set design
              | strength values (ASTM E564-06), the available test data was used in the absence of

              | specimens tested with end returns, the strength and stiffnesses were observed to be larger
              | than for comparable walls without end returns. Strength and stiffness modifiers were
              | calculated for walls with returns and were applied to adjust the measured wall strengths
              | to values that would be expected for walls without end returns. These response modifiers

              | this method of accounting for the presence of end returns is approximate, since the length

text          | Because many of the walls and rooms included openings, a shear capacity ratio was
              | calculated for each wall in order to convert strength and stiffness values for perforated
              | walls to equivalent un-perforated wall values. The measured stiffnesses were divided by
              | this ratio to obtain equivalent stiffnesses for walls without openings. The shear capacity

              | ratio underestimates that strength of walls without returns by about 20% or more (He et
              | al. 1999), the strength of walls without openings was divided by the shear capacity ratio

text          | The measured ultimate wall strengths and stiffnesses along with the modification factors
              | and modified strengths and stiffnesses for two-sided enhanced gypsum board walls with
              | wood framing are shown in Table 6.6. These modified values represent an estimate of the
              | response for walls without end returns or wall openings. The mean adjusted unit strength
              | of wood-frame enhanced gypsum walls sheathed on both sides is 17.5 kN/m (1200 lbs/ft).
              | This compares well to the strength of 18.2 kN/m (1250 lbs/ft) for specimen W6, without
              | end returns or openings. The mean unit stiffness of 4.3 kN/mm/m (7500 lbs/in/ft) also

text          | This procedure of applying modification factors to walls of different geometries to
              | estimate the response of walls without openings or returns was also followed to obtain
              | ultimate strengths and stiffnesses for enhanced gypsum walls on cold-formed steel
              | framing and enhanced stucco walls (see Figure 6.3a). The experimental and adjusted
              | strength and stiffness values for those walls are shown in Table 6.7 and Table 6.8. Again,
              | the converted strengths and stiffnesses estimated for tested enhanced walls without

text          | For design purposes, ultimate and allowable strengths must be identified for the enhanced
              | light-frame walls. While ultimate strength is defined as the peak strength of the wall, the
              | nominal strength corresponds to the force in the walls when significant damage initiates.
              | For the enhanced gypsum walls, the ultimate strength and the nominal strength are taken
              | as the same value and are the mean measured strength of the walls, adjusted for the

text          | failure of adhesive connections and peak loading in enhanced gypsum walls occur at
              | similar drift levels (~0.3%). For the enhanced stucco walls, the nominal strength was set
              | to be smaller than the ultimate strength in order to reduce the risk of damage to the
              | adhesive-attached gypsum under the design earthquake. The enhanced stucco (exterior)
              | walls reach a strength of about two times that of the enhanced gypsum (interior) walls,
              | though the initial stiffnesses are similar. At a drift level corresponding to the ultimate
              | strength of enhanced gypsum walls, the adhesive connecting the gypsum panels on both
              | sides has already been broken and considerable damage has occurred. The force in the
              | enhanced stucco walls at 0.3% drift is 20.4 kN/m (1400 lbs/ft). This value will be used to
              | define the nominal strength of the enhanced exterior stucco walls in order to coincide
              | with the drift where the enhanced gypsum walls reach ultimate strength. To summarize,
              | Table 6.9 shows the nominal strength values recommended to be used for strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced shear walls. These strength values are for two-sided walls, where the
              | stucco walls consist of stucco and glass mat gypsum sheathing on the exterior and
              | enhanced gypsum on the interior. While many building codes list strengths as one-sided
              | values (e.g., AFPA 2008; IBC 2006), here we use two-sided strengths since two-sided
              | walls were tested, and the code rules for combining one-sided strengths when dissimilar
              | materials are used on each side lead to overly conservative design strengths. The
              | strengths achieved using these enhanced finish materials are quite substantial compared
              | to the tabulated two-sided unit strength of shear walls sheathed with structural rated
              | panels. For example, the strength of two-sided 9.5 mm (3/8 in) structural wood sheathing
              | on wood framing with perimeter nail spacing of 152 mm (6 in) on center is 13.4 kN/m
              | (920 lbs/ft) (AFPA 2005), less than any of the recommended strengths for enhanced
              | gypsum and stucco wall assemblies.

text          | The components of wall deformations can be broken down into bending, shear, and

              | the contribution of the end stud or post members to the wall in-plane bending moment of
              | inertia. The contribution of wall end posts to the bending resistance is calculated based on

text          | where (Gvtv) is an effective shear stiffness term that incorporates both stiffness of the
              | sheathing material and the sheathing-to-framing fastener slip. Since enhanced walls use
              | adhesive, the fastener slip at small drifts will be quite small. The SDPWS specifies that
              | the value for Gvtv for gypsum is 0.28 kN per mm of board thickness (40,000 lbs/in). This
              | would mean that for a wall with 15.9 mm gypsum board on both sides, the value of the
              | shear stiffness term would be 8.8 kN/mm (50,000 lbs/in). This value was found to be

text          | estimating enhanced wall stiffness. Though some of the full-scale tested walls included
              | openings, the test program was not extensive enough to characterize the wide array of
              | wall opening patterns and wall aspect ratios seen in practice. For this reason, finite
              | element wall models were used to refine the conventional wall stiffness calculations.
              | Since the detailed finite element models explicitly model sheathing-to-framing fasteners,
              | sheathing panels, framing members, and hold-downs and have been validated with test
              | data, these models are considered to provide a fairly accurate representation of the
              | behavior of enhanced light-frame walls. Enhanced gypsum and stucco wall models of
              | differing lengths were created using the software Abaqus according to the procedure
              | described in Section 5.2. Each of these models consisted of 2.4 m high walls, which are
              | typical for light-frame structures. These model walls had the same fastener spacing and
              | application of adhesive as is shown in Figure 6.3. Studs were spaced at 406 mm (16 in)
              | on center and end posts consisted of two studs placed back-to-back. Where double edge
              | studs were used, adhesive was applied to both members while screw fasteners were only
              | applied to the outermost stud or plate. The maximum sheathing mesh size of 178 mm (7
              | in) was used for both enhanced gypsum board and stucco walls. Hold-downs were
              | installed at wall ends, with an axial hold-down stiffness of 12.5 kN/mm (71.2 kips/in),
              | which corresponds to that of a common hold-down specified for wood-frame walls.
              | Walls ranged in length from 0.4 m (16 in) to 7.3 m (288 in). The wall models were
              | loaded monotonically with a shear force applied to the top plate. Since the screw and
              | adhesive fastener models were fit to cyclic data, the monotonic model force-displacement
              | curves are expected to incorporate the degradation that would be expected in cyclic
              | envelope curves. All wall models included mid-height blocking and connector elements
              | to represent the behavior of panel edge taping and compound. Rotation and vertical
              | movement of the top wall plates were not constrained in the models.

text          | To calibrate the models, wall models with rigid hold-downs were first studied to
              | eliminate the variability presented by the wall hold-down stiffness. The apparent shear
              | stiffness, Gvtv, of the enhanced gypsum and stucco walls was determined by fitting
              | Equation 6.9 to the analytical wall stiffness of walls with rigid hold-downs. Since the area
              | of the end studs is known and the modulus of elasticity of the wood material was

text          | After the apparent shear stiffness of the walls has been calculated, the stiffness term
              | representing wall uplift can be incorporated into the total wall stiffness according to
              | Equation 6.9. The modeled walls were again analyzed in Abaqus, but now the vertical

text          | stiffness of 12.5 kN/mm for the end hold-downs was used. This vertical hold-down
              | stiffness was applied in tension, while the end studs bearing against the sill plate in
              | compression were assigned a very large stiffness. The wall sill plates were fixed from
              | uplift at the location of shear anchors, which were located at the mid-point between
              | vertical wall studs, starting 203 mm (8 in) from the wall ends. Figure 6.6 shows the initial
              | unit wall stiffness for the analytical enhanced wood-frame gypsum walls as well as one
              | tested wall specimen compared to the stiffness predicted by Equation 6.9 using the newly
              | determined effective wall shear stiffness. The stiffnesses shown are the unit racking
              | stiffnesses at 0.1% wall drift. The unit wall stiffnesses increase with increasing wall
              | length, with sharp unit stiffness increases when walls are increased from very narrow
              | panels up to about 2 m in length (roughly square wall aspects). At lengths above 2 m, unit
              | stiffness of the walls continues to increase, but at a more modest rate. This plot also
              | shows that the equation to estimate wall stiffness from SDPWS (Equation 6.9)
              | underestimates the enhanced wall stiffness for almost all wall lengths. When the wall
              | length is 2 m, the equation estimates stiffness 35% less than that produced in the
              | analytical model and almost 50% less than that found during testing. Since the stiffness
              | produced by the equation was very similar to the finite element results for walls with
              | rigid hold-downs, the source of this stiffness discrepancy is assumed to be due to the
              | hold-down stiffness term.

text          | Because Equation 6.9 predicts large changes in the wall stiffness based on the stiffness of
              | the hold-downs, the walls were modeled again varying the hold-down configuration from
              | infinitely stiff (no uplift allowed), to removing the wall end hold-down device
              | completely. For cases where the end hold-down was removed in the model, uplift
              | restraint was provided by the shear anchorages, which were spaced at 406 mm (16 in) on
              | center and started 203 mm (8 in) from the wall end along the sill plate. The transfer of
              | wall shear and uplift forces through wall ends with and without hold-down devices are
              | shown in Figure 6.7. Figure 6.8 shows the initial stiffnesses calculated for the enhanced
              | wood-frame gypsum walls of varying lengths with infinitely stiff hold-downs, hold-
              | downs with realistic stiffness (12.5 kN/mm), and no end hold-downs at all. When using a
              | realistic hold-down stiffness, the wall racking stiffness is greatly underestimated by
              | Equation 6.9. When no hold-downs are provided, significant racking stiffness is still
              | present in the finite element wall model, while the SDPWS predicts zero stiffness. This
              | occurs because the wall stiffness calculation (Equation 6.9) produces a value of zero
              | when no hold-down device is supplied. While not providing wall hold-downs has been
              | shown to significantly reduce light-frame wall racking strength and stiffness when
              | compared with walls that include hold-downs in many cases, walls without hold-downs
              | are still capable of resisting significant lateral loads (Oliva 1990).

text          | Figure 6.9 shows the distribution of maximum principal stresses in the gypsum wallboard
              | of two 1.2 m (48 in) wide model walls that are 2.4 m (8 ft) tall subjected to 0.1% wall
              | drift. One wall does not include hold-downs and one includes conventional end stud
              | hold-downs (Khd = 12.5 kN/mm). While stresses are much more evenly distributed across
              | the face of the wall with hold-downs, the wall without hold-downs still displays
              | considerable racking stiffness. At this level of deformation, the majority of the stresses
              | are distributed along the sill plate in the wall without hold-downs. This occurs because in
              | the absence hold-down devices, uplift forces on the end stud travel through the adhesive
              | connection, into the sheathing panels and back into the sill plate, with the adhesive
              | fasteners and gypsum acting to resist uplift of the wall end stud. Walls without hold-
              | downs have much smaller strengths than walls with hold-downs because the vertical
              | tension stresses developed at the sill plate cause premature failure of the adhesive
              | connections at the base of the wall near the uplifting end stud. Nevertheless, the stiffness
              | provided by this load transfer mechanism in enhanced light-frame walls is substantial and
              | should be included in the calculation of end hold-down stiffness to provide more accurate
              | lateral stiffness calculations.

text          | Using finite element wall models without end hold-downs, the distance of the first shear
              | anchor from the edge of walls was varied to determine the effect of this distance on
              | racking behavior. Walls of different lengths were modeled to examine the effect of this
              | shear anchor edge distance on the initial racking stiffness of strength- and stiffness-
              | enhanced walls. Figure 6.10 shows the difference in initial unit stiffness for two-sided
              | adhesive-enhanced gypsum walls of different lengths when no hold-downs are present
              | from finite element analysis. Cases where the distance from the wall edge to the first wall
              | shear anchor is 203 mm (8 in) and 406 mm (16 in) are shown. For very narrow walls
              | without hold-downs with only one shear anchor near the center of the wall, there is
              | practically no lateral wall stiffness. For walls with more slender aspects, the inclusion of
              | end hold-downs has a larger effect on unit wall racking stiffness than for longer walls.
              | Half-height walls were also modeled and it was observed that the stiffness contribution of
              | this mechanism is proportional to the inverse of the wall height, squared.

text          | Based on observations from these finite element analyses, a relationship to accurately

              | sheathing, and shear anchors. The formula, characterizing the hold-down stiffness of

text          | The values in Table 6.11 were determined by fitting the stiffness term Kmat,edge to
              | analytical finite element results using least square regression. The empirical stiffness term
              | obtained by finite element modeling was smaller for the cold-formed steel framed walls
              | than the wood-frame walls. This occurs because the contact area of the adhesive to the
              | sill plate was smaller for the cold-formed steel than for wood framed walls due to
              | framing member size. The stiffnesses of full-height walls of differing lengths from finite
              | element analysis were compared to the stiffness estimates from the new equation
              | (Equation 6.11) using the calculated stiffness parameters. Figure 6.11 shows the
              | comparison of finite element results with the stiffness equation for both enhanced interior
              | gypsum and exterior stucco walls on wood framing. These figures show that the stiffness
              | variation with length for walls with no hold-downs and walls with rigid hold-down is
              | captured well by the new stiffness equation. For both types of walls, however, the
              | stiffness of walls with realistic hold-down stiffness are still underestimated at wall
              | lengths larger than about two meters. However, this error is small and amounts to an
              | underestimate of about 10% for longer wall specimens. Since enhanced light-frame walls
              | will include a minimum stiffness requirement to avoid damaging drifts, a slight
              | underestimate of provided wall stiffness should not lead to larger than estimated drifts.

text          | The impact of wall hold-downs on wall strength was also investigated using the same

              | when compared to finite element model wall strengths. When hold-downs are provided,

              | each wall during the design earthquake. This is particularly true of walls with slender
              | aspects. For both types of walls, as the wall length increased from 0.4 m to about 6 m, the
              | unit strength increased in an almost linear fashion, leveling off at wall lengths larger than
              | 6 m. At wall lengths larger than this, the exterior (stucco) walls, in particular, show
              | strengths similar to that of comparable walls without hold-downs. It is also interesting to
              | note that the difference between wall strength for the walls with realistic hold-downs and
              | those with simulated fixed hold-downs is larger for the enhanced gypsum walls than the
              | enhanced stucco walls. This occurs because the gypsum walls lose strength quickly after
              | peak loading while the stucco walls are more ductile and display considerably larger
              | resistances at large levels of drift due to the presence of stronger and more ductile
              | fasteners.

title         | 6.2.4 Treatment of wall openings

text          | Current design procedures call for the use of factors to consider the reduced strength of
              | walls with wall openings (AFPA 2008; Sugiyama 1981). While design procedures for
              | conventional wood and cold-formed steel framed walls include instructions for the
              | treatment of walls with openings, the appropriateness of these procedures for enhanced
              | light-frame walls should be confirmed, since the peak strengths of enhanced walls are
              | reached at very small drift levels, followed by sometimes rapid strength loss at larger
              | drift levels. While the tests performed on enhanced gypsum and stucco walls at CSUS
              | (Hopkins et al. 2014) included some walls with openings, other variables were also
              | present in these experiments such as the use of wall end returns. Also, the only opening
              | investigated was a door opening placed at a constant distance from the edge of the wall
              | panel. To more fully understand the effects of varied opening patterns on wall strength
              | and stiffness, a series of seven walls were formulated using high fidelity finite element
              | models in Abaqus (Section 5.2.11). Both enhanced exterior walls with stucco and
              | gypsum and enhanced interior gypsum walls were modeled. Figure 5.60 shows the design
              | of the seven walls, where each wall was 4.9 m (16 ft) long by 2.4 m (8 ft) high and
              | included double end studs and double studs around openings (representing king stud and
              | jack stud members). Adhesive was placed along each framing member, while screw
              | fasteners were utilized only along the member closest to the wall edge or opening where
              | double members were used. Blocking was utilized at the mid-height of the walls between
              | sheathing panels in all models.

              | this opening study. These parameters include the opening area, the cumulative length of

text          | the wall segments, and the sheathing area ratio and shear capacity ratio which are given
              | by Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2. Some of the walls have similar sheathing area ratios,
              | though the location and shape of the openings differ in those specimens. Since the
              | conventional design procedure for light-frame walls utilizes shear capacity ratio for wall
              | strength, the study should confirm whether the assumption that strength is dependent only
              | on the sheathing area ratio is valid for enhanced light-frame walls.
blank         | 
text          | One of the goals of these simulations is to determine if interior hold-downs are needed
              | near doors and window openings. While conventional light-frame walls are often
              | designed with hold-downs only at wall ends, stiffer boundary conditions may contribute
              | to the development of larger strengths and stiffnesses in enhanced light-frame walls.
              | These interior wall hold-downs can also delay the onset of deformations that cause
              | gypsum panel and stucco cracking around corner openings. To investigate the impact of
              | wall hold-downs on wall racking behavior, all seven configurations were analyzed for
              | both interior gypsum and exterior stucco walls, with and without interior hold-down
              | devices. In the walls with interior hold-downs, uplift springs with the same stiffness as
              | those used at the wall ends, were included at the bottom of interior studs that were
              | adjacent to the window and door openings. A hold-down tension stiffness of 12.5 kN/m
              | (71 kips/in) was used for all interior and exterior wall hold-downs (when present).

              | analysis when uplift hold-downs were included not just at wall ends, but on stud
              | members surrounding openings. The values are compared to the estimate of wall strength
              | that is dependent on the sheathing area ratio according to Equation 6.1 (Sugiyama 1981)
              | and using the ultimate wall strengths shown in Table 6.9. The estimated ultimate wall

text          | One short-coming of this strength penalty factor is that it assumes that walls with the
              | same sheathing area ratio (Equation 6.2) will have the same strength. This assumption is
              | not always true since the number, location, and aspect ratio of the openings has an effect
              | on strength, even if the total area of openings is constant. For the perforated walls
              | studied, Wall B and Wall C have the same sheathing area ratio as do Walls E and F.
              | However, the width of the piers between the openings varies considerably. Patton-
              | Mallory et al. (1985) suggested using the ratio of the sum of the wall segment widths to
              | the overall wall length (ΣLi/L) to determine the ratio of perforated wall strength to
              | continuous wall strength. However, this method can be un-conservative for strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced walls where wall segments may be reaching and losing strength at
              | different wall drifts. A new method of estimating the lateral strength of strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced walls with openings can be investigated based on the relative stiffness
              | of the wall segments. This is an adaptation of the equation by Patton-Mallory et al.,

              | stiffness of the longest wall pier. The unit stiffness of each segment is calculated by
              | dividing the total wall stiffness calculated in Equation 6.11 by the wall length. This
              | calculation assumes that the strength of the wall is reached when the strength in the

text          | relative stiffness factor usually provides a stiffness between the stiffnesses calculated
              | using these two alternate factors. The perforated wall stiffness calculated by summing the
              | stiffnesses of the wall segments is a fairly good estimate of wall stiffnesses when few
              | openings exist. For configurations with many openings, summing the stiffness
              | contribution of individual segments leads to conservatively small estimated stiffnesses.
              | The estimates again seem to be more accurate for walls with fewer wall openings (i.e.
              | larger sheathing area ratios) than they are for walls with openings covering large portions
              | of the wall. For the enhanced gypsum walls, Equation 6.14 provided stiffness values that
              | were anywhere from 73% lower to 7% higher than the stiffness calculated using finite
              | element modeling, depending on the sheathing capacity ratio and opening pattern used.
              | Equation 6.14 provides a more conservative stiffness estimate for walls with openings
              | taking up a large proportion of wall area. For most cases, the stiffness calculated using
              | the proposed relative stiffness shear capacity ratio (Equation 6.13) provides an initial
              | stiffness estimate similar to that observed in finite element wall modeling. The range of
              | the error in the equation stiffness calculation for enhanced stucco walls is very similar to
              | that of the enhanced gypsum walls, with the equation underestimating the stiffness by a
              | larger margin for walls with many openings, except in some cases where the factor
              | proposed by Patton-Mallory was used. Comparisons of the strength and stiffness of the
              | interior and exterior walls to the values calculated using the proposed factor in Equation
              | 6.13 are shown in Table 6.12 and Table 6.13. The information summarized in these tables
              | further illustrates that the proposed strength and stiffness calculations for walls with
              | openings provide a fairly accurate estimate of wall racking strength and stiffness. For
              | walls with many openings, the calculated values become less reliable, though they are

text          | Thus far, the calculated design parameters have been compared to finite element wall
              | models where hold-downs were simulated around all openings. One factor that can
              | greatly affect the strength and stiffness of walls with many openings is the use of hold-
              | downs around wall openings away from end studs or posts. For conventional light-frame
              | walls, the perforated shear wall design approach in the SDPWS allows for the use of
              | Equation 6.12 to calculate wall strength and Equation 6.14 (neglecting the additional
              | developed hold-down term) to calculate wall stiffness when no hold-down devices are
              | included at interior wall openings. For these calculations, the shear capacity ratio in
              | Equation 6.1 is specified. Though not installing intermediate hold-downs is preferable as
              | a way to save construction and installation costs, it is recommended that for strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced walls always utilize hold-downs that are strong enough to develop the
              | strength of the wall or the maximum expected shear, whichever is smaller. Otherwise, the
              | shear stiffness provided by the adhesive and enhanced screw fasteners may be
              | compromised by flexible hold-downs. To investigate the effect of omitting hold-downs
              | around openings, the detailed finite element models for the seven enhanced wall
              | configurations were altered to remove interior hold-down stiffness. The analyses were
              | repeated to determine the strength and stiffness of the perforated shear walls where no
              | interior wall hold-downs were utilized. Figure 6.16 shows the normalized strength of the
              | finite element model walls compared to the strength calculated using Equation 6.12,

text          | using various methods to calculate the shear capacity ratio. When no intermediate hold-
              | downs are used, the estimated strength is considerably less than that found using finite
              | element analysis for most perforated wall specimens. This holds true for all of the
              | methods of calculating the shear capacity ratio. This loss of strength is more pronounced
              | than what has been found in conventional light-frame walls sheathed with structural or
              | gypsum board using dowel fasteners alone. The reason for this is that the wall panels are
              | very stiff and allowing flexibility at the end of a stud that tends to uplift forces the
              | adhesives to bridge that tensile force between sheathing and framing. This causes
              | premature failure of the gypsum adhesive near the location experiencing transverse
              | tension without a hold-down device. In some cases, the calculated wall strength was
              | twice that of the perforated wall without hold-downs. Also, because the force-
              | displacement backbone of adhesive connections show a sharp decrease in strength at
              | relatively small levels of deformation, the lack of adequate hold-downs causes the
              | perimeter adhesive connections to reach peak strength at different times, reducing the
              | wall strength and flattening out the force-displacement curve.

text          | estimated stiffness provided by using Equation 6.14 and different shear capacity ratios
              | appear to still under-estimate the wall racking stiffness for most wall specimens, even
              | without considering intermediate hold-downs. The stiffness estimates are again less
              | conservative when the Patton-Mallory et al. (1985) shear capacity ratio is used. Table
              | 6.14 and Table 6.15 show the strengths and stiffnesses calculated for the enhanced

              | values. The predicted stiffnesses utilize the proposed relative stiffness factor for the shear
              | capacity ratio. For walls with many openings, the error produced by using Equation 6.12
              | is large, with the strength being overestimated substantially. This occurs because
              | Equation 6.12 assumes the use of hold-downs at wall ends. Wall strength has been shown
              | to be much more sensitive to the presence of hold-downs than wall stiffness for high-

text          | For conventional shear wall design, it is generally conservative to use a segmented
              | strength approach, where the total perforated wall strength is assumed to be equal to the
              | strength of the sum of the wall segments between openings as long as each segment
              | utilizes appropriate anchorages and hold-downs to develop the strength of that segment.
              | This approach can be un-conservative for the design of enhanced walls since wall
              | segments of varying lengths have different initial stiffnesses and lose substantial strength
              | after peak strength is reached in each segment. For illustration, Figure 6.19 shows the
              | monotonic force-displacement curves from Abaqus modeling of a 0.8 m long wall, a 2.0
              | m long wall, the combined force-displacement curve, and the added peak strengths. For
              | the conventional wall that uses ductile screw fasteners only, the sum of the segment peak
              | strengths is about the same as the peak force of the combined force-displacement curve.
              | For the enhanced gypsum walls, however, the added peak strengths of the segments
              | produces a larger value than the peak force from the combined peak force-displacement
              | curves. For this reason, the strength of a perforated strength- and stiffness-enhanced wall

              | Wall D (Figure 5.60), which includes a door and a window, for different hold-down

title         | 6.3 Modal design procedure
text          | Since the goal of light-frame residential structures with enhanced strength and stiffness is
              | to mitigate damage during the design earthquake, it is critical to limit the levels of
              | structural deformation. A new seismic design strategy for enhanced structures is proposed
              | which is based on elastic response spectrum modal analysis. For regular one- , two- and
              | some three-story structures, the parameters needed for design can be obtained with
              | sufficient accuracy from tables, based on story strengths and stiffnesses and mass and
              | stiffness distributions in an already-designed floor plan. For structures with different
              | geometries, the approach is the same but the user will need to perform the modal analysis
              | to determine the required wall strength and stiffness at each floor. The example modal
              | analysis calculations are described in this chapter.
blank         | 
text          | The goal of the design strategy is to ensure that under the design earthquake, the
              | maximum story drift does not exceed 0.2%. This target was set because during wall and
              | room specimen tests, initial damage around screw fasteners in gypsum wallboard became
              | visible at about 0.2% drift. The peak strength of most of the enhanced gypsum wall and
              | room specimens with no stucco (i.e., interior walls) was reached at around 0.3% drift,
              | though the stiffness of the enhanced walls reduced significantly after about 0.2% drift.
              | Exterior walls reached their peak strength at a much larger deformations, but again after
              | significant loss of stiffness and observed cracking. For this reason, the limit of 0.2% was
              | chosen for seismic design.
blank         | 
text          | The concept of the design procedure can be illustrated with a simple example using an
              | elastic SDOF system. Figure 6.21a shows the design level acceleration response spectrum
              | of a SDC D site as obtained from ASCE-7 (ASCE 2010). Figure 6.21b shows the drift
              | response spectrum from the same site found by dividing the acceleration ordinates by the
              | natural frequency, squared, and assuming a story height of 2.7 m. The drift limit of 0.2%
              | imposed by the design procedure is shown to correspond to a maximum system period of
              | about 0.15 seconds for this spectrum. The periods shown on the x-axis can then be
              | converted to a ratio of SDOF stiffness to mass (Figure 6.21c). The maximum drift of
              | 0.2% is then found to correspond to a minimum stiffness-to-mass ratio of about 1800 s-2.

text          |    2. A rigid diaphragm assumption is used to transmit story shears from diaphragms to
              |        walls. Experimentation has suggested that the loads distributed to walls in
              |        conventional light-frame structures are proportional to their stiffness, suggesting
              |        that it is preferable to assume diaphragms as rigid rather than flexible (Phillips et
              |        al. 1993). This assumption makes sense since light-weight residential structures

              |        elastic prior to adhesive connection failure, which begins at drift levels of about
              |        0.3%. Since the design procedure is intended to limit wall drifts to 0.2% during
              |        the design earthquake, the assumption of linear elastic behavior is appropriate.

              | structures are very stiff, the natural periods of these buildings will be very small, usually
              | less than 0.2 seconds. Thus, the short period design acceleration, SDS, may be used for all

              | limit lateral deformations below those triggering damage and to keep the structure nearly
              | linearly elastic. If the amount of walls or their arrangement is inadequate, a modification
              | is then necessary. The design procedure is iterative. However, in many instances the
              | amount of walls required for architectural reasons is enough when using the strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced approach and iteration and modification is not necessary. There is a
              | small number of structural parameters that must be input upon beginning design and
              | adjusted if necessary based on the adequacy of the lateral strength and stiffness of the
              | current proposed structure. These variable parameters include the number of and location
              | of walls and openings, and the type of walls employed.

              | the use of a new shear and stiffness reduction factor (Equation 6.13) when wall openings
              | are present. The effective wall shear and the parameter describing the hold-down restraint
              | provided by the adhesive connections can be taken from Table 6.10 and Table 6.11,
              | respectively, for the stiffness calculations. Based on the tested and analyzed walls, only
              | strength- and stiffness-enhanced wood and cold-formed steel walls composed using the
              | specifications in Table 6.1 and Table 6.2 are envisioned to be used. The use of different
              | fastener spacing schedules or sheathing types would require additional laboratory testing
              | and finite element analysis. When calculating the bending stiffness of individual walls,
              | the area of end posts may include the area of adjacent connected studs, provided the
              | connections are sufficiently stiff and strong to prevent stud separation during wall
              | deformation. For example, if a wall includes two stud members at the end and those
              | members are connected to each other with screws and to two additional stud members in
              | a return wall, the area of four studs may be used to calculate the wall bending stiffness.
              | Similarly, if a wall with returns includes a hold-down in the wall end as well as a hold-
              | down in the return wall at the same post, the uplift resistance of both devices may be
              | considered in wall stiffness calculations. This condition exists in the exterior corners of
              | many structures, where each major wall will include its own hold-down. An illustration
              | of the hold-downs and end stud areas that may be considered for bending resistance at

              | the mode shapes and natural frequencies of the structure may be found by solving the

text          | Figure 6.26 shows this stiffness ratio value calculated as a function of mass and stiffness
              | distribution factors. For kratio,1 the required stiffness ratio of the 1st floor, a sharp change is
              | seen in the required values at KDF values between about 1.3 and 2. This occurs because
              | the controlling drift shifts from the first to the second floor as the KDF value increases
              | above this level. A similar sharp shift in required stiffness in is seen in kratio,2, the required
              | stiffness ratio for the second floor, when the vulnerable floor level changes.

text          | For most cases, the mass in the 2nd floor diaphragm and roof will be similar and the
              | stiffness distribution factors similar for the two stories as well (e.g. both ratios between
              | 0.4 and 0.6). For these common floor plan layouts, the stiffness ratios required will be
              | roughly 500 (the reciprocal of the drift limit of 0.002) for both floors. The stiffness ratios
              | for different distributions of mass and stiffness in a two-story building are given in Table
              | 6.16 and Table 6.17. These factors obtained through modal analysis are similar to that for
              | a single story structure (Equation 6.37).

text          | The modal calculations of required wall strength and stiffness at each floor were also
              | carried out for a strength- and stiffness-enhanced three-story structure, though the tables
              | produced require one more design assumption. The required mass and stiffness factors
              | are shown here for the case where 3rd story and roof mass are equal and the 2nd and 3rd
              | story lateral stiffness are equal. Other mass and stiffness distributions are possible, but
              | the required strength and stiffness at each floor level must be calculated using the modal
              | approach described earlier in this section.

text          | The wall strengths and stiffnesses have been calculated as well as the required total

text          | A preliminary estimate of maximum floor drift of multi-floor light-frame structures may
              | be used to determine quickly if a prototype structure must be re-designed. To complete
              | this estimate, the fundamental period of the structure must first be calculated. This may
              | be done using the Rayleigh equation (Equation 6.17) using any arbitrary lateral load
              | profile and the weights and lateral stiffness attributable to each floor of the building. This
              | period estimate must be made for both directions of the house and the largest period
              | taken. Using the estimated structural period, the estimated maximum story drift ratio may

title         | 6.4 Equivalent static force-based design procedure
text          | While a displacement-based design methodology achieves the goal of limiting structural
              | drifts in a building subjected to the design earthquake, most in the structural design
              | industry are more accustomed to force-based design procedures. An alternative force-
              | based procedure may be used in the design of strength- and stiffness-enhanced structures.
              | Many aspects of a force-based procedure will be similar to those of the described modal
              | procedure. Specifically, only the required strength and wall stiffnesses are calculated
              | differently (Step 5 and Step 6). The other steps described in the previous section are
              | identical. To create a design method that can be easily adopted by those in the design
              | industry, this method is similar to conventional design methods. The adjusted Steps 5 and
              | 6 for force-based design is described below. The design method is different in that
              | instead of employing a modal analysis procedure, equivalent lateral forces are calculated
              | based on the geometry and seismic hazard at the building site. The forces are applied to

text          | the structure uniformly along the floor line and force demands are ascribed to each wall
              | within the building. The structure passes the design checks if the calculated strength of
              | each wall exceeds the strength demand and if the wall racking drifts subjected to the
              | force demands are less than 0.2%. As with the modal procedure, either hand calculations
              | or simple elastic building models may be used to verify the design and this procedure is
              | intended for use only when torsional effects due to wall layout asymmetries are minimal.

title         | 6.5 Use of elastic analysis software in design
text          | Calculating the strength and stiffness of all walls and accounting for the effect of torsion
              | can be time consuming, especially for a multi-story building. As an alternative to
              | performing these calculations by hand, a three-dimensional elastic model may be built
              | using the method described in Section 5.4. In this method, all walls within the structure
              | are modeled as shell elements, with stiffness modifiers applied to the materials to provide
              | elements with the desired wall length dependent stiffness. As prescribed in the procedure,
              | only continuous wall segments are to be modeled, neglecting portions of walls above and
              | below openings. For walls that are not continuous from one floor to another, the out-of-
              | plane diaphragm stiffness above or below the wall should be modeled by placing beam or
              | joist members with realistic bending and shear stiffness. The dead load mass must be
              | applied to the diaphragms in the structure. This can be done by calculating tributary
              | weights and areas of wall and floor masses and lumping these masses at diaphragm
              | nodes.

text          | When using the response spectrum modal procedure (Section 6.3), a response spectral
              | analysis is then applied to the elastic shell model. The design response spectrum for the
              | site is determined based on conventional procedures (ASCE 2010).

text          | When using the equivalent lateral force procedure (Section 6.4) the calculated equivalent
              | lateral loads may be applied to the elastic shell element model in each direction. The
              | force demands in each wall may then be compared with the calculated strengths for each
              | wall (Equation 6.12). The walls drifts under the equivalent lateral loads may also be
              | compared to the allowable design drift of 0.2%. Wall layouts may be adjusted if the
              | strength and drift requirements under the equivalent lateral loads are not met.
blank         | 
text          | Using the elastic shell element models may result in slightly increased wall stiffnesses
              | and reduced drifts when compared to hand calculations. This occurs because the stiffness
              | equations provided that were calibrated to finite element model data do not fully account
              | for the out-of-plane stiffness of walls. While Equation 6.14 may include the stiffness
              | contribution from increased wall end stud areas from returns, the equation does not
              | consider the full out-of-plane resistance of longer walls. The elastic shell element models
              | do include increased stiffness for these out-of-plane walls, with the stiffness increase
              | matching wall test specimen results well.
blank         | 
text          | Using an elastic shell element model provides more accurate three-dimensional response
              | results than are found when using the calculations described in Sections 6.3.2 and 6.3.3
              | because torsion is considered explicitly in the model. This is especially true of the modal
              | analysis procedure, where the modal equations solved within the design software
              | consider the torsional building modes. A modal procedure that considers torsion for
              | buildings with significant eccentricities is described in Appendix B.

text          | Using Equations 6.22 and 6.23, the center of rigidity for each floor of the building plan
              | was calculated. The center of mass was also calculated using Equations 6.24 and 6.25.
              | The calculated centers of mass and rigidity are shown in Table 6.28. These distances
              | were calculated from a point that lies on front left corner of the building floor plan, if
              | looking toward the front door. The distance in each direction for each story between the
              | center of mass and center of rigidity is less than 20% the building dimension in that
              | direction (Lbuilding) in all cases, indicating that torsional effects are not expected to be
              | large. As such, the building may be designed according to the provisions of this chapter

              | significantly larger than those required. However, for one wall in the transverse direction

text          | As described previously in Section 5.4 and Section 6.5, another approach is to model the
              | house using a three-dimensional linear elastic finite element analysis program such as
              | ETABS or another commonly used analysis software. The ETABS house model using

              | segments on each floor above and below openings have been removed to avoid
              | overestimating perforated wall stiffnesses. The beams above and below interior walls
              | were modeled to approximate the flexural stiffness of the beams and joists at the
              | boundary of interior walls. This is important for walls that are discontinuous from floor to
              | floor to capture any wall rocking that may occur due to out-of-plane diaphragm
              | flexibility. The diaphragms were modeled as rigid in-plane. Dead load masses were
              | applied to each diaphragm node based calculated tributary loads.

              | contribution of wall return bearing on racking stiffness. Additionally, this model

title         | 6.7 Design requirements for index one- and three-story
              |     buildings
text          | In the previous section, the proposed modal and force-based design procedures were
              | applied to a prototype two-story house. While two-story structure layouts such as the one
              | presented are common for light-frame construction, the strict strength and drift
              | requirements imposed by these procedures for enhanced systems may be more difficult to
              | achieve for building with different geometries. For this reason, a smaller one-story house
              | and a larger three-story apartment building model were designed using the strength and
              | stiffness requirements of the modal design approach. Both structures are buildings that
              | have been analyzed in previous studies (Isoda et al. 2002; FEMA 2012). The geometries
              | and dead weight masses from both structures were taken from the cited documents.
              | Though not all of the design calculations were performed for these structures, estimates
              | of wall length and placement locations required to meet the strength and stiffness
              | requirements of the modal analysis are presented.

text          | Using the equations in the modal design procedure to calculate minimum story strength
              | and stiffness (Equations 6.37 and 6.38), the required stiffness in each loading direction
              | (Kmin) is 25.7 kN/mm, while the required strength (Vmin) is 141 kN. If the exterior walls
              | are considered to be framed according to the requirements for wood-framed strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced exterior stucco and gypsum walls (Table 6.1), then the nominal wall
              | strength is 20.4 kN/m. From the design of the two-story structure, the average unit
              | stiffness of exterior walls was 3.3 kN/mm per meter of full-height wall segment width.
              | The stiffness limit indicates that a total wall length of at least 7.8 meters must be
              | included, while the minimum strength requires at least 6.9 meters. These figures
              | represent total wall shear, neglecting torsional effects. Since the exterior walls in each
              | direction include roughly similar opening patterns, very little torsion would be expected.
              | The enhanced exterior wall length required can easily be met by enhancing only the
              | exterior house walls. The walls requiring enhancement are shown in red in Figure 6.36.

text          | Taller strength- and stiffness-enhanced buildings may be more diffictult to design using
              | the described procedure due to the requirements that are meant to keep the building
              | elastic and limit story drifts below 0.2%. These requirements not only require larger than
              | average wall stiffnesses, but also larger strengths, since inelasticities lead to large
              | deformation in short period structures. To see if this design methodology could be used
              | on a three-story structure, an index building that has been used in several studies was
              | used (Isoda et al. 2002; FEMA 2012). The plans for the thee-story apartment building are

              | flexibilities that cannot be tolerated given the strict drift limits required by this design

title         | 6.8 Summary
text          | A new design methodology was proposed for light-frame strength- and stiffness-
              | enhanced structural systems. The principal goal of this design method is to ensure that
              | large wall deformations requiring costly repair are avoided during the design earthquake
              | scenario. Based on results of gypsum and stucco wall racking tests, it was determined that
              | these walls suffered initial damage including observable deformations around dowel
              | fasteners and stucco cracking beginning at wall drifts as low as 0.2% to 0.3%.
              | Additionally, adhesive-enhanced walls have been shown to reach strength at drifts around
              | this level, with damage occurring to the gypsum backing and adhesive connections at
              | larger drifts. For these reasons, a drift limit of 0.2% was selected for enhanced light-
              | frame structures.
blank         | 
text          | The design strength of enhanced wood and cold-formed steel framed walls with strength
              | and stiffness enhancements was determined from test data. Nominal and ultimate
              | strengths were calculated for interior (gypsum) and exterior (stucco) walls on wood
              | framing and interior gypsum walls on cold-formed steel framing based on tests performed
              | at CSUS (Hopkins et al. 2014). The design strengths provided are for two-sided wall
              | configurations to properly capture the deformation compatibility of alternative sheathing
              | methods (gypsum board, glass mat gypsum sheathing, stucco).

text          | An equation used to calculate the stiffness of conventional light-frame walls (AFPA
              | 2008) was validated for use in strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame walls.
              | Apparent shear stiffness values for the enhanced light-frame wall materials were
              | calibrated to the design equation using finite element models of walls without openings
              | with rigid hold-down conditions of varying length. It was found that when using the
              | apparent stiffness term for enhanced light-frame walls with hold-downs, the equation
              | underestimated the shear wall stiffness for walls of all lengths when compared to the
              | finite element wall models. This occurs because the conventional stiffness calculation
              | neglects the influence of shear anchorages in resisting wall uplift. Through finite element
              | wall analysis, it was found that a significant amount of uplift resistance is provided by the
              | adhesive connections and sheathing material which create a stiff connection to the shear
meta          | CHAPTER 6. DESIGN OF ENHANCED LIGHT-FRAME STRUCTURES                                    327

text          | anchor nearest to the wall end. Through observed stiffness contributions from finite
              | element analysis, a new empirical wall uplift stiffness term was introduced to account for
              | the uplift resistance provided by connectors, sheathing, and shear anchors. The proposed
              | updated stiffness equation for strength- and stiffness-enhanced walls with no openings of
              | different lengths was shown to match finite element results well. Through this study, it
              | was also found that the strength of walls without hold-down devices is very small if the
              | wall length is small (i.e., large aspect ratio), but approaches the strength of a comparable
              | wall with hold-downs when the wall is long when shear anchors are provided. For longer
              | walls, the shear anchors provide significant uplift resistance. For all walls analyzed, the
              | strength of walls with commonly used hold-downs was similar to that of walls with rigid
              | hold-downs.
blank         | 
text          | In addition to investigating wall strength and stiffness relationships for continuous walls
              | of varying length, the effect of wall openings on enhanced light-frame wall racking
              | strength and stiffness were also studied. Unlike conventional light-frame walls, enhanced
              | walls often reach peak strength and shed load quickly at larger drift levels. This can lead
              | to un-conservative results when using conventional shear capacity ratios for perforated
              | walls because wall piers cannot be assumed to reach strength at similar levels of drift. A
              | new shear capacity ratio, which is used to calculate the strength and stiffness of walls
              | with openings, was introduced for enhanced light-frame walls. Through comparison to
              | finite element wall models of six perforated shear walls, it was found that strength and
              | stiffness calculations performed using the updated stiffness equation and the new shear
              | capacity ratio provide accurate predictions of perforated wall model response. The
              | behavior of enhanced walls with wall end hold-downs, but without hold-downs around
              | wall opening, was also studied using detailed finite element modeling. Not including
              | these interior hold-downs resulted in slightly reduced wall stiffness, but significantly
              | reduced wall strength. While neglecting the uplift at interior openings only reduced
              | model racking stiffness by about 15% for perforated walls, strength was reduced by about
              | 50%. These results indicate that for strength- and stiffness-enhance light-frame wall
              | systems, hold-downs must be used around all wall openings if each full-height wall
              | segment is to be used for lateral resistance.

text          | A design procedure was developed for enhanced light-frame structures when torsional
              | effects are minimal. The procedure assumes rigid diaphragm conditions and masses
              | lumped at the floor levels. After an initial design of wall layouts based on building
              | functionality, the stiffness and strength of individual walls are calculated using the
              | equations that were calibrated to finite element wall results. Both a modal and force-
              | based equivalent lateral force procedure were developed. When using the modal
              | procedure, minimum story stiffness and strength requirements are produced based on the
              | distribution of mass and stiffness between building floors. For one- , two-, and certain
              | three-story structures, the parameters needed to calculate the required strength and
              | stiffness in each floor have been tabulated, eliminating the need for modal analysis
              | calculations. The required strength and stiffness in each wall within the structure are
              | assigned based on relative wall stiffness. If the minimum strength and stiffness
              | requirements are met in all walls within the structure, the building passes the design
              | checks. In the alternate force-based procedure, equivalent lateral loads are applied to the
              | structure in a manner similar to that used in conventional design procedures (ASCE
              | 2010), assuming elastic performance (R-factor of 1.0). Racking forces tributary to each
              | wall within a story can be calculated and the nominal strength compared to the applied
              | forces. The building is considered to have passed the design checks if all walls
              | experience loading under the procedure less than their nominal strengths and no wall drift
              | exceeds 0.2%. For both design approaches, iteration may be necessary to develop a
              | structure with sufficient wall strength and stiffness. With either design method, the elastic
              | shell element models described in Section 5.4 may be used to apply the response spectral
              | or lateral force loading and find the wall racking forces and drifts. When an elastic shell
              | element model is used, the simulated building will likely be somewhat stiffer than
              | calculated wall stiffness values would indicate. This occurs because the shell element
              | models explicitly simulate the effect of out-of-plane stiffness, which may be only
              | partially captured by the design equations.

text          | Finally, example design calculations were demonstrated using both the modal and force-
              | based procedure on a prototype two-story wood framed structure. The results of the
              | analysis showed that sufficient strength may be supplied to conventional light-frame

text          | walls in a floor plan that did not include an excessive amount of walls. The resulting
              | strength requirements in each wall imposed by both design procedures were very similar,
              | indicating compatibility between the two design approaches. Additionally, a one- and
              | three-story index building were analyzed. While the full-building design calculations
              | were not performed, the required enhanced wall locations and lengths were calculated
              | and shown on the building floor plans. These calculations demonstrated that to meet the
              | design requirements, one-story structures often include more than enough walls in their
              | layout to allow for the strength and stiffness requirements to be met using enhanced light-
              | frame walls. In taller, three-story or higher buildings, the procedure often does not allow
              | for plentiful openings on the first floor such as may be desired for tuck-under parking,
              | which are common in some light-frame structures. This makes sense since the strength
              | requirements force the structure to remain elastic under the design earthquake; this
              | becomes more difficult to achieve at the ground level of taller structures without the
              | implementation of additional enhanced walls.

title         | 7.1 Introduction
text          | Over the past several decades, the use of base isolation as a means for limiting seismic
              | deformations and accelerations in structures has become increasingly popular. Though
              | isolation has been most often used in the U.S. in large steel and concrete structures, the
              | principles governing the application of this technology are also applicable to less
              | expensive, wood and cold-formed steel framed construction. However, the isolation of
              | light residential structures is challenging because many commercially-available isolation
              | systems are prohibitively expensive relative to the cost of residential structures, making
              | isolation economically unfeasible for many home owners. Additionally, many isolation
              | systems require large seismic masses to effectively provide a flexible isolation layer.

text          | Several researchers, however, have attempted to overcome these challenges. Sakamoto et
              | al. (1990) performed numerical and physical simulations on a two-story house isolated
              | with three different types of rubber bearings. The system was shown to reduce the peak
              | accelerations transmitted to the superstructure by around 70%. Though the results from
              | this analysis were favorable, elastomeric bearings that can accommodate large isolation
              | displacements are often relatively stiff given the small mass of residential structures and
              | are may not be effective during moderate seismic events. Other researchers in Japan have
              | also demonstrated the effectiveness of elastomeric dampers in isolating light structures
              | (Sakamoto et al. 2006; Yamanouchi et al. 1998), though in some cases considerable mass
              | was added to the isolated diaphragm to overcome the large stiffness of the bearings. Pall
              | and Pall (1991) performed analysis on a flat-slider bearing system for the base isolation
              | of a two-story wood house in Montreal, Canada. The system of bearings with sliding
              | friction coefficients of 0.2 installed along the top of the basement walls were able to
              | reduce peak roof acceleration by more than 40% when compared to the fixed-base
              | structure. However, since this system was installed within the width of a basement
              | bearing wall, only relatively small displacements could be accommodated. Therefore this
              | system may not be suitable for high seismic regions where sliding displacements can be
              | very large (e.g. more than 40 cm). Self-centering was also not provided, though this
              | system was shown to be quite inexpensive when compared to other base isolation
              | schemes. Reed and Kircher (1986) performed numerical analysis on a five-story wood
              | building retrofitted with both elastomeric rubber bearings and flat sliding bearings. While
              | the systems were found to reduce peak base shear transferred into the superstructure by
              | more than 70% for both systems, the friction coefficient assumed for the sliding system
              | was only 1%, which is unrealistically small for most sliding systems produced with low-
              | cost materials. Furthermore, although very low friction systems require wind restraint
              | devices and can lead to small lateral force demands, they are associated with very large
              | displacement demands in the isolation system, requiring very large isolation bearings.
              | Zayas and Low (1997) performed analysis on a four-story wood structure in the Marina
              | District of San Francisco retrofitted with friction pendulum system (FPS) bearings. Their
              | analysis results indicated that the peak story drift of the structure subjected to the design

              | FPS bearings (Mokha et al. 1991a; van de Lindt et al. 2011). These isolation systems,

text          | Sliding isolation systems are an attractive option for light-weight structures as they can
              | be relatively inexpensive and do not require a large mass to be effective. Researchers
              | have investigated using polytetrafluoroethylene- (PTFE, commercially known as Teflon)
              | to-steel sliding bearings as a means of reducing friction coefficients in flat surface sliding
              | systems (Mostaghel and Khodaverdian 1987; Mokha et al. 1990; Constantinou et al.
              | 1987; Constantinou et al. 1990; Mokha et al. 1991b; Dolce et al. 2005). Unfilled PTFE
              | sheets, glass-filled PTFE sheets, and woven PTFE have all been tested. These studies
              | show that the friction coefficient of PTFE-to-steel sliding surfaces decreases with
              | increasing bearing load. The friction coefficient was also found to increase with
              | increasing sliding velocity, saturating at around 13 cm/s (5 in/s). These sliding isolators
              | display a higher breakaway friction coefficient when initially moving from rest. This
              | higher breakaway friction behavior could act as an effective wind restraint.

text          | Researchers have investigated the effect of varying sliding bearing friction coefficients
              | on the response of base isolated structures. Jangid (2000) recommended an optimum
              | friction coefficient which minimized accelerations for a structure with supplemental
              | damping and restoring force when subjected to a single ground motion. Mostaghel and
              | Tanbukuchi (1983) also studied the effect of a single ground motion on a one-story
              | structure with varying mass ratios and friction coefficients. Still others have investigated
              | the effect of restoring springs on sliding systems (Constantinou et al. 1991). While there

title         | 7.2 Ground motion selection
text          | In order to determine the behavior of different isolation systems subjected to ground
              | shaking, a group of ground motions were selected for this analysis. A suite of broadband
              | ground motions compiled by Baker et al. (2011) was selected and scaled for use in this
              | analysis. The original set was chosen as representative of a site 10 km from a moment
              | magnitude 7.0 event occurring on a strike-slip fault with a Vs30 of 250 m/s. This group
              | consists of 40 bi-directional ground motion sets. This broadband set of motions was
              | selected as to provide a suite with a mean response spectrum, but to preserve variability
              | in the responses.

text          | Both horizontal ground acceleration components were applied to the isolation system for
              | each analysis. For scaling purposes, the square-root-of-the-sum-of-the-squares (SRSS) of
              | the two component spectra for each motion were determined. The entire group of motion
              | pairs was scaled by the same factor so that the mean of the 5% SRSS damped response
              | spectra of the 40 motions exceeded the MCE spectrum for downtown Los Angeles (zip
              | code 90071), as computed using the method outlined in ASCE 7 (ASCE 2010) over the
              | period range of interest. The ASCE method for isolation requires that the mean of the
              | SRSS of the component motions exceeds the design spectrum between periods of 0.5
              | multiplied by the design earthquake isolated period and 1.2 multiplied by the MCE
              | isolated period. This resulted in an equivalent period scaling window between
              | approximately 0.3 seconds and 3 seconds. However, because of the shape of the mean
              | response spectrum, the limits required to clear the MCE spectrum at all intermediate
              | periods were about 0.2 and 7 seconds. For this analysis, a VS30 of 350 m/s (1,150 ft/s,
              | class D) was considered. Figure 7.1 shows the MCE response spectrum calculated as well
              | as the SRSS response spectra from the 40 ground motion pairs scaled by a factor of 2.97.

title         | 7.3 Analytical model
text          | The isolation system was modeled as a simple one-node two degree-of-freedom (one
              | horizontal DOF in each perpendicular direction) rigid block slider subjected to horizontal
              | accelerations in both horizontal directions. Vertical motions were not imposed. Though a
              | real structure would include multiple degrees of freedom, the simplification of a rigid
              | superstructure was made in order to generalize the results, as light-frame structures have
              | relatively small natural periods and are fairly rigid compared to taller, heavier buildings.
              | This one-node analysis would not be appropriately applied to understand the response of
              | buildings where higher mode effects are considerable, but is appropriate to characterize
              | the force and deformation demands on the isolation systems for strength- and stiffness-
              | enhanced light-frame structures.      Three components of the isolation system were
              | modeled: a simple sliding bearing, a linear elastic restoring force, and a linear viscous
              | damper. The sliding bearing was modeled to have a very stiff elastic-perfectly plastic
meta          | CHAPTER 7. SLIDING ISOLATION PARAMETRIC STUDY                                            335

text          | response. This behavior suggests virtually no sliding of the isolator until the lateral
              | accelerations overcome the friction coefficient value of the slider moving over the sliding
              | surface. When this lateral force is reached, the isolator is free to move. The initial break-
              | away friction coefficient would be higher than the kinetic friction value. Also, the friction
              | coefficient of most PTFE-to-steel slider bearings is velocity dependent. These factors
              | were neglected by assuming a Coulomb velocity and pressure independent friction
              | coefficient, µ, that was varied in the parametric study to simplify the analysis and
              | produce results that are not specific to a specific type of sliding bearing. The modeled
              | restoring spring offers a perfectly linear elastic response with a constant stiffness. The
              | viscous damper was modeled as having a damping coefficient that varies linearly with the
              | velocity of the isolation system relative to the ground. In an actual isolated building, the
              | restoring force could be either supplied by mechanical springs or a concave dish-like
              | sliding surface with constant curvature while the supplemental damping could be
              | provided by viscous dampers. Viscous damping and restoring stiffness were considered
              | uncoupled in the two sliding directions, with coupled sliding direction-dependent friction.
              | For the purposes of this study, the weight of the isolated SDOF system was 356 kN (80
              | kips). This weight corresponds to the approximate calculated dead load of a two-story
              | wood frame house with a floor area of about 167 m2 (1800 ft2) that was described in
              | Section 6.6. Equation 7.1 describes the equations of motion governing the seismic
              | response of the system in the two directions of sliding and Figure 7.2 shows a free body
              | diagram of the single-node isolated house.

              | response of a slider where only one sliding direction is permitted. Also shown is the total
              | response of all three of these isolation components combined. Both friction and

title         | Peak Displacement
blank         | 
text          | One of the most important responses of an isolation system is the peak displacement.
              | This response parameter has important implications for both the isolation system and the
              | superstructure. A large anticipated peak displacement means that the building must have
              | a large separation from neighboring structures, a large moat, or that landscaping must be
              | placed far from the structure as to not prohibit building motion. If the edge of the isolator
              | is set to coincide with the edge of the superstructure, a large peak sliding displacement
              | may also mean a larger cantilever to keep the isolators tucked under the building edge.
              | Peak displacement also governs how large the sliding surface under each isolator must
              | be. This, in turn, could control isolation cost since the sliding surface of a friction
              | isolation system can be expensive if the required area is large. Figure 7.4 shows a 3D
              | surface that illustrates the variation of mean peak isolator displacement for the MCE level
              | analysis motions for isolation systems with no damping with varying restoring stiffness
              | (k) and friction coefficient (µ) values. The displacement shown is the mean of the peak
              | displacement in any direction measured from the center point of the isolator for each pair
              | of records averaged over all 40 motions. When the friction coefficient and restoring
              | stiffness are both small, the mean peak isolator displacement is very large. In particular,
              | systems with no damping and no restoring force experience very large peak
              | displacements (e.g., in excess of 100 cm) if the friction coefficient is less than about 0.1,
              | indicating that while small friction coefficients are efficient in reducing lateral forces,
              | they require very large (and more expensive) isolators when located in regions of high
              | seismicity. This is an important finding since many previously developed sliding isolation

text          | For a clearer representation of these results, Figure 7.5 shows how the mean peak isolator
              | displacements vary with friction coefficient and restoring stiffness for three different
              | damping values. Since friction sliding systems do not have constant periods of vibration,

              | as is commonly done for other structures. For a reference to compare analysis damping

              | s/cm in compression and 0.205 kN-s/cm in rebound (Salem and Galal 2009), therefore
              | the largest level of damping coefficient shown in this graph is approximately achieved

text          | displacement reductions of 22%, 53%, and 75%, respectively. When restoring force is
              | added, the peak displacement increases for systems with small friction coefficients (less
              | than about 0.04 for a restoring stiffness of 1 kN/cm), while decreasing for systems with
              | larger friction coefficients. For a system without viscous dampers and a friction
              | coefficient of 0.2, a restoring stiffness of 1.0 kN/cm reduces the mean peak displacement
              | by more than 20% while a restoring stiffness of 4.0 kN/cm reduces the response by more
              | than 35%. But as mentioned previously, increasing the coefficient of friction is more
              | effective in reducing the peak displacement than increasing the restoring force (or
              | increasing curvature in sliders with concave sliding surfaces). Adding viscous damping is
              | also a very effective way of reducing peak displacement demands, especially when the
              | friction coefficient is small. For a sliding system with no restoring stiffness, providing
              | viscous damping of 0.35 and 0.75 kN-s/cm (approximately equivalent to the damping
              | provided by 2 and 4 shock absorbers, respectively) in each direction reduces peak
              | displacements for a system with a friction coefficient of 0.05 by 50% and 66%,
              | respectively when compared to the system without viscous damping. When the friction
              | coefficient is increased to 0.2, the reduction is 36% and 51% for the two levels of
              | damping, respectively. The coefficient of friction and level of viscous damping are shown
              | to influence the peak isolator displacement considerably, while the amount of restoring
              | stiffness is found to influence this response to a much lesser extent.

text          | The results of this parametric study show that peak isolator displacements decrease with
              | increasing friction coefficient and viscous damping. At friction coefficients less than
              | about 0.07, the maximum isolator displacement remains large, while larger friction
              | coefficients can lead to significantly reduced peak displacements. Increasing restoring
              | stiffness was found to also reduce the peak isolator displacement in most cases, though
              | the effect was more modest. When friction coefficients were small (<0.05), providing

              | small, no adjustments will be needed to re-center the isolation system after a sizeable
              | earthquake. If ineffective self-centering is provided, the building will have to be moved
              | back into place using alternate means. This re-centering might be necessary to prepare the
              | isolation system for a future seismic event or for serviceability reasons. If the structure is
              | heavy, this process could be quite labor and cost intensive. The existing building code

text          | Figure 7.6 shows the effect that the sliding friction coefficient, restoring stiffness, and
              | damping coefficient were found to have on the mean residual displacements produced by
              | the analysis ground motions. The displacement shown is the residual displacement in any
              | direction from the center point of the isolator. For systems without supplemental damping
              | or restoring stiffness, residual displacements are quite large. The mean peak residual
              | displacement is about 70% of the peak displacement when no damping or restoring
              | stiffness is provided. Adding restoring stiffness drastically reduces residual mean isolator
              | displacements. For a system without supplemental damping and a friction coefficient of
              | 0.2, providing restoring stiffnesses of 1.0 kN/cm and 4 kN/cm reduces the residual
              | displacement by 83% and 93%, respectively, when compared to the system without
              | restoring springs. The effectiveness of the restoring spring to self-center the mass
              | becomes less effective at larger friction coefficients because the friction force must be
              | overcome by the spring to effectively re-center the building. Supplemental damping is
              | also shown to reduce mean residual displacements, especially for systems without
              | restoring springs. For a system without restoring stiffness and a friction coefficient of 0.2,

              | 0.70 kN-s/cm reduces residual displacements by 44% and 61%, respectively when
              | compared to the building without supplemental damping. However, it should be noted
              | that this reduction in residual displacement produced by viscous damping primarily
              | occurs because the peak displacement is also reduced.

text          | To provide effective isolation, the peak base shear coefficient, representing the peak
              | lateral force transmitted through the isolation system to the superstructure as a percentage
              | of the building weight, must be considerably less than that of a fixed-base structure.
              | Transferring too much load through the isolation layer can lead to large structural
              | accelerations and damage in the superstructure. However, since strength- and stiffness
              | enhanced structures are designed to remain nearly elastic under the design earthquake,
              | the seismic coefficient corresponding to damage initiation would be quite high in seismic
              | areas (in excess of 0.7 or 0.8), meaning that most sliding isolator combinations analyzed
              | would result in little to no superstructure damage for an enhanced light-frame house.
              | Controlling floor accelerations is also important to protect building contents and other
              | acceleration sensitive components from seismic damage. For these sliding isolation
              | systems with assumed rigid superstructures, the peak base shear coefficient is equal to the
              | peak absolute acceleration.
blank         | 
text          | Figure 7.8 shows the mean base shear coefficient for varying friction coefficients,
              | restoring stiffnesses, and linear viscous damping coefficients. When there is no
              | supplemental damping or restoring spring present, the peak base shear increases linearly
              | with increasing friction coefficients since the peak force in the system is equal to the
              | coefficient of friction times the weight of the system. When a restoring spring is added,
              | the peak base shear increases, especially for low friction systems. This happens because
              | small friction coefficients lead to large peak displacements, and the restoring force is
              | proportional to the peak displacement. For a system with a friction coefficient of 0.2 and
              | no supplemental damping, adding restoring springs with a stiffness of 1.0 kN/cm and 4.0
              | kN/cm has the effect of increasing base shear by 42% and 149%, respectively, when

              | damping decreases the peak shear for systems with large restoring stiffnesses and
              | increases the peak shear for those with small restoring stiffnesses. This occurs because
              | when the restoring stiffness is large, the elastic spring attracts large loads at large

              | base shear by 35% and 61%, respectively when compared to the system without
              | supplemental damping. For systems with no supplemental damping, it is recommended
              | that the restoring stiffness be kept small (i.e., 1.0 kN/m or at most 2.0 kN/m) in order not
              | to exceed base shear seismic coefficients of about 0.5. These values provide an adequate

text          | Figure 7.10 shows the mean responses of sliding systems with a constant friction
              | coefficient of 0.2, but variable restoring stiffness and damping. These plots suggest that
              | increasing viscous damping is especially effective in reducing mean peak isolator
              | displacements and mean peak velocities. Mean residual displacements appear to be much
              | more dependent on restoring stiffness than damping. Again, these plots show that when
              | the friction coefficient is constant, increasing damping increases the base shear
              | coefficient at small restoring stiffness values, but decreases the shear coefficient at large
              | restoring spring stiffnesses.

text          | When comparing systems A and B, the mean peak velocities of the systems are almost
              | the same. System B, which includes supplemental viscous damping, produces mean peak
              | base shear and mean residual displacement that are only 4% and 17% less those that of
              | System A, respectively. These results further suggest that the benefits of isolator viscous
              | damping can alternatively be achieved by increasing the friction coefficient (in this case
              | using µ of 0.25 instead of 0.15 and without adding a viscous damper).

text          | When comparing System A and System C, which includes a restoring spring, System C
              | produces a much smaller mean residual displacement, while increasing both mean peak
              | velocity and mean normalized base shear. The added restoring spring stiffness, though
              | small, decreases residual displacement by 77% while increasing base shear and velocity
              | by 22% and 14%, respectively, when compared to System A. This indicates that while
              | restoring stiffness is very effective at reducing residual isolator displacements, this
              | required self-centering of the system must be balanced with the allowable base shear to

title         | 7.5 Summary
text          | The results of this study inform the relative importance of friction sliding coefficient,
              | restoring spring stiffness, and viscous damping in controlling the various response
              | parameters that are of interest in sliding isolation systems for strength- and stiffness-
              | enhanced light-frame structures. The results suggest that varying the friction and viscous
              | damping coefficients are most effective in limiting peak displacements, while restoring
              | stiffness can dramatically reduce residual isolation displacements. In many instances,
              | increasing the friction coefficient has a similar effect on response as adding supplemental
              | viscous damping. For this reason, it may be more cost effective and practical to increase

text          | the friction coefficient of the sliding system to achieve the desired response as opposed to
              | installing costly viscous dampers. The peak base shear coefficient and peak absolute
              | acceleration are sensitive to increases in friction coefficient, supplemental damping, and
              | restoring stiffness. In particular, systems with large restoring stiffnesses can attract very
              | large base shear forces. This is especially true when the friction and damping coefficients
              | are low and large displacements occur. Increasing restoring stiffness increases the
              | isolation velocity while increased viscous damping reduces the peak velocity.
blank         | 
text          | Since strength- and stiffness-enhanced wood and cold-formed steel framed structures can
              | be subjected to larger base shear coefficients than taller buildings without encountering
              | significant damage, friction coefficients in excess of 0.2 for an isolation system should
              | not cause damage to the superstructure. These larger friction coefficients are favorable in
              | that they lead to smaller isolator displacements and smaller, less expensive sliding
              | surfaces and bearings since peak and residual displacement demands will be smaller.
              | Additionally, sliding interfaces with larger friction coefficients often include less
              | maintenance such as lubrication, which may be required for very low-friction systems.
              | Including modest levels of restoring stiffness (on the order of 1.0 kN/cm for this 356 kN
              | structure) produces structures that self-center to within 7 cm after strong ground shaking
              | (and typically would not need any further re-centering) while increasing base shear by
              | less than 15% when compared to the system without restoring stiffness.

title         | 8.1 Background
text          | Performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) allows engineers to quantify the
              | seismic performance of structures in terms of monetary loss, casualties, and loss of
              | building functionality. PBEE tools can be helpful in evaluating the performance of a
              | structure and ensuring that the seismic behavior meets the expectations of the building
              | owners, occupants, and other stakeholders (e.g., city officials, financing institutions,
              | insurers, reinsurers, etc.). Quantifying the seismic performance of structures through the
              | described measures also allows for a direct comparison between building systems. The
              | full PBEE framework is characterized by an equation that expresses the frequency of
              | incurring losses according to the following relationship (Deierlein et al. 2003):

              | median drift of about 0.3% in a representative wall model. The analysis showed that

              | acceleration corresponding to collapse to the design level spectral acceleration was 1.7.

text          | Vigh et al. (2012) performed a seismic performance evaluation of cold-formed steel
              | archetype buildings using the methodology of FEMA P695. While the collapse margin
              | ratios were found to be adequate in most cases, the authors suggested smaller R-factors
              | for buildings over 5 floors. Using constant wall strength on all floors, which was
              | suspected to promote the formation of story mechanisms, was also found to not
              | significantly impact the structure’s seismic collapse performance.
blank         | 
text          | Other factors have been shown to affect the seismic collapse performance of light-frame
              | structures. Lucksiri et al. (2012) modeled a variety of one-story wood framed structures
              | with varying floor areas and layouts. They found that one-story buildings with roughly
              | square floor plans resisted damaging drifts better than long, narrow structures. For
              | structures with similar exterior boundary dimensions, those with large cutout areas in
              | plan (e.g., a courtyard) showed better response because of reduced seismic mass. Van de
              | Lindt et al. (2010a) applied an IDA procedure to a six-story wood-frame building
              | designed using two different procedures. Comparing the IBC force-based procedure (IBC
              | 2006) and a direct-displacement design (DDD) approach (Pang et al. 2010), they found
              | that the DDD designed structure experienced larger base shears and smaller story drifts
              | than the building designed using the more conventional force-based procedure. The effect
              | of sheathing material and level of building finish has also been shown to influence the
              | performance of light-frame structures. Goda and Atkinson (2011) analyzed a two-story
              | model wood-frame structure with different degrees of wall finishes. The researchers
              | found that the house modeled with rated OSB sheathing, gypsum partitions, and stucco
              | experienced only small levels of damage, while a comparable house with exterior
              | horizontal board cladding and interior gypsum partitions experienced heavy damage,
              | nearing collapse.

title         | 8.2 Prototype house and simple building archetypes
text          | In order to ensure appropriate collapse safety of enhanced light-frame structures, accurate
              | building models were developed and subjected to ground motion records leading to
              | collapse. Ideally, many building archetypes of varying geometries would be designed
              | according to the developed procedures (Chapter 6) and evaluated to study collapse
              | performance for the entire class of structures. While a wide array of building layouts have
              | not been developed for this study, the two-story wood-framed structure described in
              | Section 6.6 was modeled using the equivalent diagonal wall model approach detailed in
              | Section 5.3 of this dissertation. The finite element modeling approach described in
              | Section 5.2 was used to determine the force-drift behavior of each strength- and stiffness-
              | enhanced wall. Then, simplified nonlinear equivalent diagonal wall models were fit to the
              | data from the high fidelity analysis. In most cases, the parameters estimated for the
              | equivalent diagonal elements using the procedure described in Section 5.3 required only
              | minimal adjustment to agree with the behavior from detailed finite element analysis. For
              | illustration, the unit force-displacement behavior of the enhanced interior gypsum walls
              | and enhanced exterior stucco walls are shown in Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.2, respectively.
              | The equivalent diagonal element behavior is shown along with the wall behavior from
              | experimental testing. While the behavior shown is for walls with lengths of 4.9 m, the
              | strength and stiffness parameters for each element model were adjusted based on wall
              | length and the presence of openings according to the procedure described in Section

text          | 5.3.3. Based upon the test results of tested conventional wood framed walls (CoLA-UCI
              | 2001), parameters were also fit to wall models for conventional wall assemblies. A
              | conventional house with the same floor plan as the enhanced house with and without wall
              | finishes was modeled. In the house without finishes, only the walls required by the
              | International Residential Code (ICC 2012) were incorporated. These included the exterior
              | OSB sheathing and gypsum on the interior of exterior walls, but other interior partition
              | walls and all exterior stucco were neglected. For the conventional house with finishes, the
              | stucco on exterior walls and all interior gypsum partitions were incorporated into the
              | model.

text          | To study the performance of enhanced light-frame structures on sliding isolation systems,
              | the strength- and stiffness-enhanced wood-frame house was subjected to PBEE analysis
              | with two different kinds of sliding isolation systems. Both systems are high friction (e.g.,
              | µ between 0.15 and 0.3) with no added damping. One system utilizes flat sliding surfaces
              | (no restoring force) and another uses concave isolator sliding surfaces, which provide a
              | restoring force proportional to the curvature of the surface. No maximum allowable
              | isolation layer displacement was imposed. Rather, the structure was permitted to slide as
              | far as necessary in the analyses, assuming that either the isolator would be sized to resist
              | the demand or that the consequences of sliding off of the flat isolators would not be
              | severe. By not modeling an isolator drift limit, these rates may be compared for a variety
              | of potential sliding plate sizes. For future studies, the effect of sliding off of the isolation
              | plates and impacting a moat or the ground could be modeled directly (FEMA 2009).

text          | To augment analyses of the fully designed two-story structural layout, simple building
              | archetypes were developed to study the behavior of structures with different allowable
              | enhanced light-frame wall layouts. The modal design procedure developed (Section 6.3)
              | requires minimum story strength and stiffnesses to meet drift limits under the design
              | earthquake. The procedure allows for differences in mass and stiffness distribution
              | between different floors of a structure. To further explore the collapse performance of
              | alternate configurations, several simplified one-, two-, and three-story index building
              | models were developed using OpenSees (Mazzoni 2006). A representation of one of
              | these simple two-story archetypes is shown in Figure 8.3. These models consisted of 6.1
              | m (20 ft) square areas on each floor. The diaphragms were considered rigid in plane. The
              | walls on each floor were modeled using the phenomenological equivalent diagonal struts
              | described in Section 5.3. The parameters were altered for differing wall lengths according
              | to Equations 5.10 through 5.12. Geometric nonlinearities were included in the analysis,
              | although given the relatively low mass-to-strength ratios of these systems, these
              | nonlinearities only affected lateral stability at large levels of deformation. Different
              | distributions of mass between the floors were considered, varying from a heavy second
              | floor and light roof to a heavy roof and light second floor. Walls were only included on
              | the exterior of each floor, with the minimum wall lengths calculated based on mass and

text          | stiffness distributions as specified in the proposal design procedure. In this way, the
              | analysis results represent the performance of the minimum conforming configurations for
              | strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures because they often include fewer
              | walls than might be included in typical structures. For almost all realistically designed
              | structures, the collapse performance is expected to be better than that found using these
              | simplified archetypes. While the floor plans of these archetypes are not representative of
              | typical light-frame houses, the archetype studies will provide a lower bound on expected
              | performance of enhanced light-framed systems.

text          | Three different configurations of mass and wall stiffness were considered for the two-
              | story archetype models. In one configuration, the mass tributary to the roof and second
              | floor were the same, as were the stiffnesses (wall lengths) provided. The second
              | configuration included a second story that was twice as heavy as the roof and a second
              | story with twice as much lateral stiffness as the first. This may be representative of a
              | house with an open plan on the first floor and many walls on the second floor. The third
              | configuration included a roof that was twice as heavy as the second floor and a first story
              | that was twice as stiff as the second story. While this range of mass and stiffness

title         | 8.4 Multiple-stripe analysis (MSA) procedure
text          | The procedure described in FEMA P695 (2009) is intended to evaluate the generalized
              | collapse safety of structural systems, and it is not appropriate for calculating other limit
              | sates. For example, the procedure utilizes a set group of ground motions scaled so the
              | median spectral value of the motions meets a target spectral coordinate. Though a
              | spectral shape factor is later applied, this simplification does not fully consider response
              | spectral shape, which can vary significantly with changing ground motion intensity.
              | Furthermore, the procedure neglects the slope of the seismic hazard curve, neglects near
              | fault effects, and makes other simplifying assumptions. While these simplifications have

text          | been shown to adequately capture collapse margin ratios of archetype structures, a
              | different type of dynamic analysis should be employed to determine the intensity-
              | dependent drift fragility of light-frame structures.
blank         | 
text          | For this purpose, a multiple-stipe analysis (MSA) was performed on specified
              | conventional and enhanced light-frame buildings. MSA consists of applying intensity-
              | and site-specific ground motions to a structural model at specific spectral acceleration
              | levels. Previous researchers have observed that site-specific elastic response spectra vary
              | not only in scale at different hazard intensities, but also in spectral shape. The conditional
              | spectrum reflects changes in spectral shape at different intensity levels for a building with
              | a specific period subjected to site-specific seismic hazards (Baker and Cornell 2005;
              | Baker and Cornell 2006; Baker 2010). To capture spectral shape variations at different
              | intensities, different sets of scaled ground motions were selected at different spectral
              | acceleration levels depending on hazard level, using an algorithm developed by Jayaram
              | et al. (2011). Motions scaled to the spectral ordinate and shape of the conditional
              | spectrum were selected for probabilities of exceedance of 50%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, and
              | 1% in a 50 year period for a site in Los Angeles (zip code 90071) with a VS30 of 350 m/s.
              | Additionally, an even larger intensity ground motion set with a 1% probability of
              | exceedance in 200 years was considered. The 2008 United States National Seismic
              | Hazard Maps (Petersen et al. 2008) were used in selecting the motions. Twenty ground
              | motion pairs were selected for each hazard level, applying each pair to each structure
              | twice, switching the orientation of the ground motion pairs. This was not done with the
              | simplified archetypes since the floor plans were doubly symmetric. Figure 8.5 shows the
              | mean MSA spectra at varying hazard levels for a structure with a period of 0.14 seconds,
              | consistent with the enhanced two-story light-frame house modeled. As can be seen in
              | Figure 8.5, as the seismic intensity at the structural period of the MSA motions is
              | increased, the spectra become more peaked at the conditioning period. This is evident
              | when inspecting the spectra at periods much larger than that of the light-frame structure
              | (>1 sec), where the difference in the median conditional motions is much smaller than at
              | the conditioning period of 0.14 seconds.

text          | For illustration, the parameters used to select the ground motions at each hazard level at a

              | interest, ε, defines the number of standard deviations by which an observed ground
              | motion spectral ordinate differs from the mean logarithmic spectral acceleration
              | computed using a ground motion attenuation equation (Baker and Cornell 2005). For this
              | analysis, the mean event magnitude and source distance from deaggregation were used
              | along with the target spectral acceleration at the first mode period to calculate ε using the
              | Campbell-Bozorgnia ground motion predication equation (Campbell and Bozorgnia
              | 2008). For this site, as the motion set return period becomes larger and larger, both the
              | spectral accelerations and parameter ε increase. Large values of ε indicate a large peak in
              | the target spectral shape at the period of interest, while a value of zero would indicate that

              | curve for two periods is shown in Figure 8.6. One period represents that of the fixed-base
              | two-story house without base isolation (0.14 seconds), and the other represents the

              | Namely, modeling uncertainty, test data uncertainty, and uncertainty related to the

              | static pushover analysis was performed in both the longitudinal and transverse directions
              | of each structure type analyzed. The pushover curves for the enhanced light-frame house,

              | conventional house without architectural finishes are shown in Figure 8.7a, b, and c,
              | respectively. The base shear is normalized by the applied gravity loads and masses,

text          | which includes 105% of the structural dead load and 25% of the live load, as prescribed
              | (FEMA 2009). Since live loads are significant when compared to dead loads in light-
              | frame structures, the presence of 25% leads to significantly smaller collapse fragilities
              | than would be found if live load were not considered. It can be seen from the plots that
              | the enhanced light-frame house reaches a peak strength in the transverse direction of 458
              | kN (103 kips), while the peak base shear strength for the conventional house with and
              | without finishes is 295 kN (66.3 kips) and 245 kN (55.1 kips), respectively. For this
              | layout, the base shear strengths of the conventional house with and without finishes in the
              | transverse direction were somewhat similar because inelasticities concentrated on the
              | open first floor where few architectural partitions were included. The difference in the
              | initial stiffness of the different structures is also notable. The lateral roof secant stiffness
              | at 0.1% roof drift in the transverse direction of the enhanced house, the conventional
              | house considering wall finishes, and the conventional house without considering finishes
              | is 44.5 kN/mm, 29.6 kN/mm, and 21.1 kN/mm, respectively. It can also be seen that there
              | is far less stiffness degradation in the enhanced house pushover curve before maximum
              | pushover strength is reached, when compared to the conventional house with and without
              | architectural finishes. Peak base shear in the transverse direction is reached at roof drifts
              | of 0.42%, 0.50%, and 0.57% for the enhanced house, the conventional house with
              | finishes, and the conventional house without finishes, respectively. These drifts are about
              | half of the maximum first floor drifts, since inelastic deformations were concentrated in
              | the ground floor for all archetypes. The pushover curves in the longitudinal and
              | transverse direction are sometimes markedly different. This occurs because the
              | cumulative length of walls in the transverse direction is smaller and many of the wall
              | segments have larger aspect (height-to-length) ratios. Though significant strength loss
              | occurs when the drift surpasses the base shear strength in the enhanced house, significant
              | reserve strength is sustained at roof drifts in excess of 1%, similarly to the conventional
              | house models. This suggests that even though peak strength is reached at a small drift
              | ratio in the enhanced house, ductility is still supplied to the system in the form of
              | substantial shear resistance at large deformations. It should also be noted that the force-
              | displacement behavior of individual walls was fit to the cyclic envelope data, because no
              | monotonic tests were performed on strength- and stiffness-enhanced walls. Using these

text          | It should be kept in mind when viewing these fragility curves, and all fragility curves in
              | this chapter, that the ground motions were selected by matching the geometric mean of
              | the two ground motion components to the target spectral acceleration. This was done
              | because the hazard curves used for integrating fragilities are based on the geometric mean
              | of the ground motion components (Petersen et al. 2008). This measure of spectral
              | acceleration differs from that used in the U.S. Seismic Design Maps (ASCE 2010), where
              | the maximum-direction spectral acceleration is employed. The geometric mean spectral
              | acceleration will always be smaller than the maximum-direction spectral accelerations

text          | The calculated parameters used to determine the adjusted collapse margin ratio for each
              | structure are shown in Table 8.4. The ductility of each structure was calculated using the
              | roof level drift determined from analysis and using Equation 8.5. The collapse margin
              | ratio was taken as the median spectral acceleration causing collapse divided by the MCE
              | spectral ground motion intensity and multiplied by a factor of 1.2 to account for the
              | behavior of a three dimensional model. The MCE ground motion intensity was taken as
              | 1.5 g, considering a SDC D location (neglecting near fault types where intensities have
              | much larger values). The adjusted collapse margin ratio was then calculated for each
              | structure using the collapse margin ratio and the spectral shape factor (SSF), which was
              | close to one for most of the structures analyzed due to the short periods typical in light-
              | frame construction. The SSF is a factor that recognizes that the response spectra for rare
              | ground motions such as the MCE often have a distinct shape, where the spectral ordinate
              | at the period of interest sits at a peak, with the ordinates at smaller and larger periods
              | having smaller values. This distinct spectral shape differs from that of computed code
              | spectra (ASCE 2010). In FEMA P695, values of SFF are tabulated and vary for different
              | structural periods, period-based ductilities (µT), and seismic design categories.

text          | Confidence in the basis of the design requirements was considered to be good,
              | corresponding to a design requirement collapse uncertainty (βDR) of 0.2. While this
              | design method is relatively untested and may normally warrant a lower confidence, the
              | requirements of the procedure are quite stringent and require much more lateral strength
              | and stiffness than would be permitted when using conventional design procedures. The
              | confidence in test data was considered to also be good, corresponding to a test data
              | collapse uncertainty (βTD) of 0.2. This level of confidence was justified because many
              | tests of sheathing-to-framing fasteners, panel edge connections, wall panels, and room
              | enclosures have been tested in relation to this project. The behavior of these components
              | is well understood and testing was repeated in many cases to capture different
              | configurations that may be present in structural systems (e.g., wall end returns, openings,
              | anchorages). The confidence in the robustness of the structural model was taken as good
              | and assigned an uncertainty value (βMDL) of 0.2. This degree of model confidence was
              | selected because the force-displacement behavior of each wall in the models was adjusted
              | to account for wall length and openings, with further calibrations to high fidelity finite
              | element models performed in many cases. It should be noted that the selection of these
              | parameters was somewhat arbitrary, but the enhanced structure would still pass the

text          | uncertainty (βTOT) is 0.6, which is somewhat larger than the calculated uncertainty in
              | most cases. For all three structures, the adjusted collapse margin ratios exceed the
              | allowable values for 10% and 20% collapse probability. The adjusted collapse margin
              | ratio of the strength- and stiffness-enhanced house is 52% larger than the 10% collapse
              | probability allowable value, while the conventional house with and without finishes
              | provide adjusted collapse margin ratios 29% and 8% larger than the required values. If a
              | larger total collapse uncertainty of βTOT = 0.6 is used, then the collapse margin ratio of the
              | conventional house without considering finishes is slightly smaller than the 10%
              | probability allowable adjusted collapse margin ratio. This is compatible with the findings
              | of Christovasilis et al. (2009) that houses designed according to current code procedures

text          | The peak story drift fragility at drift levels was calculated using the MSA procedure.
              | Figure 8.10 shows the drift fragility curves for the three structural models. In each case,
              | the maximum drift occurs in the first floor of the structure in the transverse direction. The
              | points in the plot represent the probabilities of exceedance based on the analysis results,
              | while the curves represent lognormal cumulative distribution functions (CDF) fit to the
              | analytical data using the maximum likelihood method (Equation 8.9). The parameters
              | fitted to each distribution for all three structures at different levels of drift are shown in
              | Table 8.5. The median spectral intensity causing exceedance of 0.2% story drift in the
              | enhanced structure is about 41% larger than that of the conventional house including
              | finishes and 110% larger than that of the conventional house without finishes. This
              | drastic difference in fragilities suggests that the enhanced light-frame house can sustain
              | significantly larger seismic intensities with less damage when compared to conventional
              | construction. This difference also highlights the role of building finishes in conventional
              | construction in significantly limiting damaging drifts during moderate seismic events
              | (Filiatrault et al. 2002). The median spectral acceleration corresponding to exceedance of
              | 0.3% and 1.0% drift are from 20% to 30% larger for the enhanced house than the
              | conventional house with finishes. The median intensity corresponding to the exceedance
              | of these larger drifts are from 40% to 70% larger for the enhanced house than the
              | conventional house without finishes. It is also interesting to note that the lognormal
              | standard deviations of the drift fragility curves are smaller for the enhanced house than
              | for either of the conventional house systems. This will result in smaller probabilities of
              | exceeding these drift levels and is likely due to the more elastic response of the enhanced
              | light-frame walls at small drifts when compared to conventional walls. As expected, the
              | lognormal standard deviations of the spectral accelerations tend to increase somewhat for
              | all structural systems with increasing drift levels. For the enhanced house, conventional
              | house considering finishes, and conventional house not considering finishes, the median
              | geometric-mean spectral accelerations corresponding to 0.2% story drift, where damage
              | initiates, are 1.03 g, 0.73 g, and 0.49 g, respectively. Since the spectral acceleration
              | corresponding to the design earthquake is about 1.0 g using maximum-direction spectral
              | acceleration (about 0.82 g when using geometric mean spectral acceleration), the ratios of

text          | The collapse fragility curves for the three house types using MSA are shown in Figure
              | 8.11. The lognormal distribution parameters fitted to the MSA results are shown in Table
              | 8.6. The largest intensity of the seven stripes only corresponds to a 20% to 30%
              | probability of collapse in all three archetypes. For computing the mean annual frequency
              | and probability of collapse, the collapse fragilities are integrated with the slope of the
              | seismic hazard curve. This means that only the collapse fragility curve within a window
              | of most likely site intensities will contribute substantially to the collapse risk. So although
              | the collapse fragility curves do not include analysis points where the majority of the
              | ground motions in the set cause collapse, as long as the fragilities within the lower
              | portion of the collapse fragility function (in this case, for spectral accelerations less than
              | about 2.5 g) are estimated accurately, the probabilities of collapse should be calculated
              | with relatively good confidence (Eads et al. 2013). It should also be noted that the median
              | collapse intensities using this MSA procedure are larger than those estimated using the
              | FEMA P695 (2009) procedure, even when those values are multiplied by the SSF. The
              | MSA procedure explicitly considers the differing influence of the spectral shape at
              | different intensities, and therefore may provide a better estimate of the median collapse
              | intensity than the FEMA P695 procedure.

text          | The probability of exceeding drift limits and incurring collapse were then calculated
              | using the seismic hazard curves for the building site (Figure 8.6) and the fragility
              | functions determined from MSA. The mean annual frequency of surpassing a demand
              | parameter limit state was calculated using Equation 8.10. The mean annual frequencies of
              | surpassing several drift limits as well as the corresponding probabilities of exceeding
              | those drift limits in 50 years for the prototype two-story structures at the Los Angeles site
              | are shown in Table 8.7. The probability of exceeding a drift level of 0.2% in 50 years for
              | the conventional house with finishes is about three times that of the enhanced house,
              | while the probability of exceeding that drift in a conventional house without considering
              | finishes is about five times larger. This is significant since damage to the gypsum and
              | stucco finishes in many light-frame buildings have been observed at drifts between 0.2%
              | and 0.3% (Arnold et al. 2003; McMullin and Merrick 2007). This means that strength-
              | and stiffness-enhanced structures have 3 to 5 times smaller probabilities of being
              | damaged than conventional light-frame structures. The probability of exceeding 1.0%
              | story drift in the conventional house with and without finishes in 50 years is more than
              | two and four times larger, respectively, than the probability of exceeding this drift in the
              | enhanced structure.

title         | 8.6 Comparison of isolated two-story enhanced
              |     structures
text          | In addition to fixed-base structures, the enhanced two-story prototype structure described
              | was modeled to include two different economic sliding isolators at the base. Both flat
              | friction sliders and sliders on a dish-shaped plate (upward concave sliding surface) with a
              | radius of curvature of 2.0 m (80 in) were modeled. The flat sliders provide no restoring
              | force while the dish-shaped surface provides a restoring stiffness equal to the weight
              | tributary to the isolator divided by the radius of curvature of the dish-shaped sliding plate.
              | For the analyzed structure, the restoring stiffness of all isolators combined is 2.25 kN/cm
              | (1.28 kips/in). This is based on the isolated structural weight of 457 kN (103 kips). This
              | is significantly larger than the weight of the fixed-base house model (319 kN or 72 kips)
              | because the weight tributary to the additional isolated diaphragm directly above the
              | isolation plane must also be considered. Though the full design of this diaphragm will not
              | be discussed in this dissertation, the proposed diaphragm above the isolators is lighter
              | than most isolation systems previously developed for base isolated houses (e.g., in Japan
              | isolated house diaphragms are usually built with steel framing) because it is composed of
              | laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and conventional wood framing and sheathing members.
              | Twelve isolators are used to support the isolation diaphragm floor framing, based on the
              | optimal framing spans. The locations of the isolator units are shown in Figure 8.13. As

              | 2014). Velocity dependent friction can be described by three parameters in addition to the
              | slider velocity according to Equation 8.12 (Constantinou et al. 1990).

text          | investigated, these sliders were chosen for analysis because they represent a lower bound
              | of the optimal friction coefficient for light weight structures, are low cost, and have good
              | long-term properties. This lower bound friction coefficient will produce a displacement in
              | the sliders that is on the upper limit of what would be expected for high-friction enhanced
              | light-frame structures. This model did not consider the break-away force seen in many
              | sliding systems prior to initial sliding. The force required to initiate motion on a friction
              | slider that has not yet moved may be substantially higher than the low velocity friction
              | coefficient (Armstrong 1988), though once this force is overcome, the velocity-dependent
              | friction model proposed approximates sliding system behavior quite well (Jampole et al.

              | the maximum force transferred into the superstructure at large intensities saturates and is
              | equal to the coefficient of friction multiplied by the superstructure weight. At all intensity

              | no drift-related superstructure damage should occur when flat sliders with these
              | properties are used. The drift threshold for minor cracking of stucco and gypsum walls is

text          | The two-story strength- and stiffness-enhanced two-story house was analyzed using both
              | the FEMA P695 and MSA procedures for flat and dish-shaped sliding isolators.
              | Originally, the dish-shaped isolators were designed to have an allowable sliding distance
              | of 35.6 cm (14 in) based on the estimated response of sliding systems subjected to the
              | MCE for a SDC D site, though the plates could be designed to accommodate larger
              | sliding distances. The results from both FEMA P695 analysis and MSA were used to
              | determine the frequency of exceeding the considered allowable sliding radius of the dish
              | slider of 35.6 cm. The fragility curves for exceeding this limit displacement in the
              | isolated strength- and stiffness-enhanced structure at the Los Angeles site are shown in
              | Figure 8.17. Both results from the FEMA P695 and MSA procedures are shown. For the
              | FEMA P695 results, the intensity corresponding to surpassing 35.6 cm of displacement in
              | the isolation system was determined for each ground motion pair, using linear
              | interpolation between intensities as needed. As expected, the median spectral
              | accelerations leading to isolator displacements larger than 35.6 cm are smaller when the

text          | Two-story simplified archetypes were selected for additional investigation because most

              | Systems where the entire lateral force resisting system is supplied by either enhanced

              | stucco-gypsum (exterior) walls. While most light-frame structures would be use stucco as

              | for cases in which the exterior cladding might be provided by another material (e.g.,

              | enhanced stucco-gypsum walls are about twice that of the archetypes with enhanced
              | gypsum walls alone. When comparing structures utilizing the same wall materials but

text          | distributions are close to meeting the acceptable levels for a 10% probability of collapse
              | during the MCE, when the calculated dispersions of βTOT equal to 0.44 or 0.50 are used,
              | but these cases fail to meet the ACMR10% when the general βTOT equal to 0.6 is used.
              | However, in all cases, the systems meet the ACMR20% limit. According to the FEMA
              | P695 procedure, the mean adjusted collapse margin ratio for many archetypes must limit
              | the probability of collapse to 10% during the MCE. However probabilities of up to 20%
              | are permitted for individual archetypes. Since these simplified archetypes represent
              | buildings with the absolute minimum length of wall permitted by the design procedure,
              | realistic building archetypes would be expected to provide significantly more collapse
              | safety in most cases. The simplified archetypes modeled with stucco-gypsum walls meet
              | the required collapse margin ratios by a very comfortable margin for all cases studied.
              | The enhanced stucco-gypsum archetypes perform better than the enhanced gypsum-
              | gypsum archetypes because the stucco walls reach peak strength at a larger drift (~1.0%)
              | than the gypsum walls (~0.3%). The hysteresis curves of tested enhanced gypsum-
              | gypsum and stucco-gypsum walls with wood framing are shown in Figure 8.1 and Figure
              | 8.2. While both wall types include significant reserve resistance at large drifts, the forces
              | resisted by the enhanced stucco-gypsum walls are larger than those resisted by the
              | enhanced gypsum-gypsum walls at large drifts. The stucco-gypsum walls also include
              | significant strength reserves since the nominal strength of these walls was selected to
              | limit drift, while the nominal strength of gypsum-gypsum walls was selected at a drift
              | near ultimate wall strength. Figure 8.18 compares the adjusted collapse margin ratios to
              | the allowable values for these simplified archetypes assuming a constant dispersion of
              | βTOT = 0.5.

text          | In addition to these two-story simplified strength- and stiffness-enhanced archetypes,
              | one- and three-story configurations were investigated (Table 8.2). For these simplified
              | archetypes, only configurations with interior gypsum-gypsum walls were modeled
              | because these walls have been shown to be more vulnerable to collapse than stucco-
              | gypsum walls. In these archetypes, the mass and stiffness provided at each floor was
              | constant, since differences in mass and stiffness distributions between floors are not
              | expected to lead to significantly differing collapse margin ratios based on observations
              | from the two-story simplified archetype analyses. The calculated FEMA P695 procedure
              | parameters and adjusted collapse margin ratios are shown in Table 8.11 along with the
              | allowable adjusted collapse margin ratio values. The two-story archetype is the same as
              | the enhanced two-story simplified archetype with the first mass/stiffness configuration
              | (Table 8.10). The calculated collapse margin ratio is larger for the one-story structure
              | than for taller structures and the ratio for the two-story structure is larger than for the
              | three-story structure. This makes sense since increased height leads to larger
              | concentration of demands and P-Δ effects in the critical story. These nonlinearities are
              | negligible at small drift ratios, but become considerable at drifts greater than about 5%.
              | For taller buildings the wall inelasticity is often concentrated in the first floor and not
              | distributed along the height of the structure. This type of story concentrated failure is
              | typical in light-frame structures where wall layouts are determined largely on
              | requirements for building functionality. For all three structures, the adjusted collapse
              | margin ratios calculated exceed those permitted for 20% probability of collapse during
              | the MCE when calculated dispersions βTOT equal to 0.42 or 0.50 are used. In fact, the
              | adjusted collapse margin ratio for the one-story structure meets the requirements for a
              | 10% probability of collapse. When using a larger dispersion (βTOT) of 0.6, the three-story
              | structure does not meet the required adjusted collapse margin ratio for a 20% probability
              | of collapse under the MCE. Again, these adjusted collapse margin ratios are somewhat
              | concerning because they do not meet the requirements for a 10% probability of collapse
              | during the MCE, though they do meet the requirements for a 20% probability of collapse.
              | Fully-designed archetypes would need to be modeled and subjected to the FEMA P695
              | procedure to fully capture the probability of collapse in strength- and stiffness-enhanced
              | light-frame structures. For illustration, the calculated adjusted collapse margin ratios, as

text          | MSA was also used to study the drift and collapse performance of simplified stucco and
              | gypsum two-story archetypes. The fragility curves at different drift levels for these
              | simplified gypsum-gypsum and stucco-gypsum archetypes are shown in Figure 8.20. The
              | median and logarithmic standard deviation of the spectral accelerations associated with
              | these drift levels are also included in the plots. The median spectral acceleration causing
              | exceedance of 0.2% drift in the enhanced gypsum-gypsum and stucco-gypsum simplified
              | archetypes are 0.70 g and 1.21 g respectively. At first glance, the spectral acceleration
              | corresponding to 0.2% drift in the enhanced gypsum-gypsum archetypes seems small
              | given that the design procedure is intended to keep drifts to about this level under the
              | design level earthquake, which corresponds to a spectral acceleration of about 1.0 g for
              | many seismic areas. However, as mentioned previously the accelerations shown on the x-
              | axis of these plots are the geometric-mean spectral accelerations, while those used by
              | design codes (ASCE 2010) use maximum-direction accelerations. These plots could be
              | normalized to show code consistent accelerations by increasing the spectral acceleration
              | ordinate of each point by about 20% to 35% as previously described. While the initial
              | stiffness of the stucco-gypsum walls is only about 20% larger than the gypsum-gypsum
              | walls, this difference in median intensities causing this drift level are substantial. This
              | occurs because the gypsum-gypsum walls lose strength and incur large drifts when the
              | nominal wall strength is exceeded, while the stucco-gypsum walls include substantial
              | reserve strength beyond 0.2% drift. As was observed in the document outlining the
              | FEMA P695 procedure (FEMA 2009), collapse margin ratios are usually about 20%
              | smaller for three-dimensional models when compared to two-dimensional models. It is
              | expected that the mean intensities causing exceedance of certain drift limits would be
              | larger if two-dimensional analysis had been utilized. Inspecting the fragility curves for
              | exceeding 0.3% story drift, the median intensity causing 0.3% drift exceedance for the
              | stucco-gypsum walls is significantly larger than that at 0.2% drift, while the median
              | intensity values for both drift levels are practically the same for the simplified archetype
              | with gypsum-gypsum walls. Again, this occurs because the stucco walls include
              | substantial reserve strength while the gypsum-gypsum walls lose strength rapidly after
              | these small levels of drift are exceeded. The median spectral acceleration corresponding
              | to 1.0% drift in the stucco-gypsum simplified archetype is almost three times larger than

text          | that found for the gypsum-gypsum structure. As with the previous two-story house
              | archetype analysis, the logarithmic standard deviation of the spectral acceleration causing
              | a drift level exceedance increases for increasing levels of drift. This occurs because at
              | small levels of drift, the archetypes are nearly elastic, while at larger drift levels, the
              | inelastic response creates a larger uncertainty in the peak response.

title         | 8.8 Conclusions
text          | In this chapter, a performance evaluation of strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame
              | structures was carried out using a performance-based earthquake engineering framework.
              | Both the FEMA P695 and MSA procedures were used to characterize the drift and
              | seismic collapse performance of a fully designed two-story woodframe house designed
              | with strength- and stiffness-enhanced walls and wood framing. Enhanced stucco-gypsum
              | walls were used for exterior walls (Figure 8.1), while enhanced gypsum-gypsum walls
              | were used for interior walls (Figure 8.2). A comparable house with the same floor plan
              | was designed with conventional wall materials and design procedures without
              | considering finishes (e.g., gypsum partition walls and stucco cladding) and with finishes
              | for comparison against the enhanced house. All models were three-dimensional and
              | subjected to bi-directional ground motions. Through a prescribed FEMA P695 procedure
              | (FEMA 2009), it was found that the adjusted collapse margin ratio of the enhanced house
              | exceeded acceptable values by a comfortable margin. The adjusted collapse margin ratio
              | was larger for the enhanced house than the conventional house without finishes and the
              | conventional house with finishes. The adjusted collapse margin ratio of the house without
              | finishes was slightly smaller than the acceptable value for a 10% probability of collapse
              | in 50 years, though only by a narrow margin.
blank         | 
text          | When subjecting the three house types to MSA for a building site in Downtown Los
              | Angeles, it was found that the probability of exceeding a drift limit of 0.2% was about
              | three and five times larger for the conventional house with finishes and the conventional
              | house without finishes, respectively, than for the enhanced house. Since this drift level
              | corresponds to the onset of damage for gypsum and stucco walls, seismic damage
              | initiation is significantly delayed in enhanced light-frame structures when compared to
              | structures designed according to conventional methods. The probability of collapse for
              | the fully-designed enhanced two-story structure is less than half that of the conventional
              | house with and without finishes over a fifty year period. This analysis suggests that for
              | this specific archetype, the enhanced house would incur significantly less damage than
              | comparable conventional light-frame structures when subjected to seismic intensities not

text          | causing collapse. The collapse risk of the strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame
              | house is also significantly smaller than that of the comparable conventional structure.
blank         | 
text          | In addition to the fixed-base archetypes described, two base isolated strength- and
              | stiffness-enhanced houses of the same geometry were subjected to FEMA P695 analysis
              | and MSA. Both HDPE sliders on galvanized flat plates and dish-shaped plates were
              | studied. The dish-shaped isolators had a diameter of 80 cm (32 in) and a radius of
              | curvature of 2.0 m, corresponding to a total restoring stiffness of 2.25 kN/cm. The surface
              | slider friction coefficient of both isolator types was about 0.17 under large velocities,
              | representing a lower bound of friction coefficients found to be appropriate for enhanced
              | light-frame structures on sliding isolation systems. For both flat and dish-shaped sliding
              | systems, it was found that even at large isolator displacements in excess of 40 cm (16 in),
              | the drifts in the superstructure were below 0.1%. At this level of deformation, no damage
              | should occur in drift-sensitive components in the structure. The dish-shaped isolators
              | were initially designed to accommodate 35.6 cm (14 in) of displacement. The results of
              | FEMA P695 analysis and MSA were used to determine the probability of exceeding this
              | isolator drift level. It was found that the probability of exceeding an isolator drift of 35.6
              | cm for this friction coefficient at the selected Los Angeles site is between 2% and 3% in a
              | 50 year period. The probability of exceeding this isolator displacement was slightly larger
              | for the flat isolators than for the dish-shaped isolators. This is expected since the restoring
              | stiffness provided by the dish-shaped sliding surface reduces the peak isolator
              | displacements somewhat in most cases when compared to flat sliders. While the
              | probabilities of exceeding 35.6 cm of isolator displacement are larger than the probability
              | of collapse for the enhanced fixed-base house, the isolated systems are likely to have a
              | lower collapse risk since sliding off of the isolation system would not likely result in
              | collapse. To further reduce the probability of sliding off of the base isolation system, the
              | size of the sliding plate could be increased and/or the friction coefficient of the isolation
              | system could be increased by utilizing a different sliding material. Additionally, dish-
              | shaped sliding surfaces could be supplied with smaller radii of curvature, though this
              | approach cannot limit peak displacements substantially.

text          | Finally, several simplified enhanced fixed-base archetypes were subjected to both the
              | FEMA P695 procedure and MSA. These simplified archetypes were not fully designed
              | structures, but simple rectangular archetypes supplied with the minimum length of wall
              | required by the design procedure. Two-story simplified archetypes modeled with
              | enhanced gypsum-gypsum walls and stucco-gypsum walls were modeled with different
              | mass and stiffness distributions between floors. One- and three-story simplified
              | archetypes were also modeled with enhanced gypsum-gypsum walls only. It was found
              | that structures modeled with only the enhanced gypsum-gypsum walls, which in general
              | would not be used as exterior walls, barely met the required adjusted collapse margin
              | ratios for individual archetypes while the enhanced stucco-gypsum walls provided
              | significantly larger collapse safety levels. The distribution of mass and stiffness between
              | floors was not found to significantly affect collapse safety since these distributions are
              | considered during design. It was found that collapse margin ratios for multi-story
              | strength- and stiffness-enhanced structures were smaller than for one-story structures.
              | The collapse margin ratios calculated using the FEMA P695 procedure and the
              | probabilities of collapse using the MSA indicate that for enhanced gypsum-gypsum
              | walls, the collapse safety requirements of FEMA P695 are met by designing according to
              | proposed procedure. The collapse probabilities of enhanced stucco-gypsum simplified
              | archetypes were about four times smaller than those of enhanced gypsum-gypsum
              | archetypes, indicating significantly different behavior of the two wall types. These
              | differences in collapse performance occur because the design procedure was intended to
              | limit drift during the design seismic event, not create a uniform collapse risk between
              | archetypes with different ratios of gypsum-gypsum and stucco-gypsum walls.
blank         | 
text          | While these results suggest that several simplified enhanced archetypes using gypsum
              | wallboard alone are just on the cusp of passing the FEMA P695 requirements, additional
              | investigations would provide additional information on the collapse performance of these
              | structures. In an evaluation of the FEMA P695 procedure applied to wood structures, it
              | was found that many factors could influence computed performance (NAHBRC 2011). In
              | particular, the cyclic procedure used to fit wall test data, viscous damping ratios used, and
meta          | CHAPTER 8. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF ENHANCED STRUCTURES                               403

text          | assigned quality ratings were found to all influence the evaluation results significantly,
              | with many analyzed combinations not passing the checks of FEMA P695.
blank         | 
text          | To fully confirm the collapse safety of enhanced light-frame structures, additional
              | building archetypes must be designed according to the specified design procedure and
              | subjected to the FEMA P695 analysis procedure. Typical light-frame building layouts
              | should be used. To confirm the results of this study, additional investigations are needed.
              | The influence of different wall model types, models fit to different cyclic loading
              | protocol data, and various viscous damping ratios could all produce significantly different
              | collapse evaluation results. If the gypsum-gypsum walls are found to provide insufficient
              | collapse safety for a number of applicable archetypes, several steps could be taken to
              | improve life safety for enhanced light-frame structures. The R-factor used in design could
              | be reduced, or the use of enhanced gypsum-gypsum walls alone as a lateral resisting
              | system could be restricted to buildings of specific geometries (e.g., one- and two-story
              | buildings).

text          | Over 90% of structures in the United States are low-rise light-weight wood and cold-
              | formed steel framed shear wall buildings (Kircher et al. 1997). While most of these
              | structures have been largely successful in protecting life safety during previous

text          |      Develop a design concept for light-frame wood and cold-formed steel shear wall
              |       structures with enhanced strength and stiffness. This involves enhancing the
              |       strength and stiffness of conventional light-frame structures to tolerate larger
              |       loads with smaller levels of deformation. The goal of these concepts is to provide
              |       collapse safety under extreme ground motions (MCE) while eliminating damage
              |       during more common (design level) seismic events.
              |      Implement this design concept for light-frame construction by using conventional
              |       construction technologies. This can be accomplished by enhancing the
              |       contribution of architectural finish materials such as gypsum wallboard and stucco
              |       cladding to the lateral resistance by improving sheathing-to-framing connections
              |       and providing stronger and stiffer wall connections to adjacent members.
              |      Develop modeling approaches for enhanced light-frame systems. These should
              |       include models that can be used to determine the effect of component behavior
              |       (e.g., sheathing-to-framing fastener) on wall response, as well as less detailed
              |       models that can be used for capturing global behavior during repeated dynamic
              |       analysis and to aid in design. These models would use equivalent diagonal
              |       element to represent entire walls or wall segments.
              |      Formulate design methods for strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame
              |       systems that provide life safety while limiting structural drift demands under
              |       moderate to strong ground motions. Develop a reliable and practical method of
              |       analyzing and designing these structures.
              |      Explore the use of inexpensive sliding base isolation systems combined with
              |       enhanced light-frame systems for areas of very high seismicity (i.e., near fault
              |       locations). Identify the parameters of sliding base isolation systems that lead to
              |       improved performance of strength- and stiffness-enhanced systems.
              |      Validate the efficacy of strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures
              |       with and without isolation through the use of validated nonlinear analysis models.

title         | 9.2.1 Strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame design concepts
blank         | 
text          | A series of analyses were conducted to estimate the strength, stiffness, and ductility that
              | would be required in strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures to mitigate
              | damage during the design earthquake, yet provide sufficient collapse safety during larger
              | earthquakes. Achieving this performance with the amount of walls typical in light-frame
              | structures is desirable, as to not affect the architecture and functionality of these
              | buildings. Based on the onset of damage observed in previous stucco and gypsum-
              | sheathed wall tests, it was decided that limiting story drifts to 0.2% to 0.3% under design
              | level earthquake demands would be an appropriate target to limit damage. Because
              | inelastic deformations can be large for short-period systems, strength- and stiffness-
              | enhanced structures must be designed to remain elastic or nearly elastic during the design
              | earthquake to prevent damage to architectural finishes. Based on several typical two-story
              | small wood framed house floor plans used in newer California subdivisions, the average
              | two-sided strength required in shear walls to keep typical houses elastic is about 21
              | kN/m. The required lateral stiffness was found to be about 4 kN/mm/m. These figures are
              | based on a two-story house with an average dead load of 2.4 kN/m2 (50 psf). While these
              | unit strengths and stiffnesses are large for typical light-frame structures, these targets are
              | achievable by making inexpensive enhancements to wall sheathing-to-framing fasteners.
              | To provide adequate collapse safety during the MCE event, it was found that a ductility
              | capacity, defined as the ultimate wall drift divided by the yield wall drift, of three to four
              | would be required for these structures. Since peak strength is achieved at small drifts
              | (0.2% to 0.3%) for enhanced light-frame systems, this required ductility does not
              | correspond to a large drift demand.

title         | Screw and adhesive gypsum-to-framing connections
blank         | 
text          | Testing of wood and cold-formed steel gypsum-to-framing fasteners showed that the use
              | of inexpensive construction adhesives can greatly enhance gypsum-to-framing
              | connection performance. Connections made with adhesives plus screw fasteners
              | increased connection strengths by three to six times and initial stiffness by six to eight
              | times, when compared to conventional screw connections. Additionally, the adhesive
              | connections remained almost elastic until connection failure, whereas screw fastener
              | connections showed significant softening at small levels of deformation.
blank         | 
text          | Additional conclusions from these experiments are:
blank         | 
text          |       Screw gypsum-to-framing fasteners failed by crushing the surrounding gypsum,
              |        fastener bending, and sometimes fastener breakage under repeated reverse
              |        loading. Gypsum crushing against the screw shank causes the highly pinched
              |        hysteretic behavior that is observed for screw gypsum-to-framing connectors.
              |       Screw fastener damage became visible at wallboard-to-framing displacements of
              |        about 1 mm. At this level of deformation, the drywall compound and paint over
              |        the screw head began to crack and deform. This damage became more visible at
              |        larger levels of deformation with fasteners crushing the surrounding gypsum.
              |       Screw fastener connections to cold-formed steel were on average about 20% less
              |        stiff and less strong than comparable connections to wood framing. This is due to
              |        rotation of the screw through the point of penetration of the cold-formed stud
              |        flanges.

              | 
text          |       Screw fasteners displayed un-symmetric behavior when installed close to gypsum
              |        edges, with decreased strength when the fastener was pushed in the direction
              |        perpendicular to the panel edge. This asymmetry can be reduced by providing a
              |        larger fastener edge distance, though practical construction details and member
              |        thicknesses limit the maximum edge distance.
              |       Adhesive gypsum-to-framing connections on wood framing typically failed by
              |        pulling the back of the gypsum paper backing off of the wallboard panel. While
              |        providing for a very stiff and strong connection prior to failure, this failure of the
              |        adhesive connection through the gypsum paper backing was not always visible
              |        until the specimen was deconstructed. This means that since the failure does not
              |        occur within the adhesive layer, the use of stronger adhesive in general would not
              |        lead to stronger connections.
              |       Adhesive connections were about 1.5 to 2.0 times stronger and stiffer with wood
              |        framing as opposed to cold-formed steel framing. This is due to better bonding of
              |        the adhesives to wood than to cold-formed steel framing. Alternate construction
              |        adhesives were tested and are recommended for use with cold-formed steel
              |        framing to produce a better bond to the non-porous metal surface. The use of
              |        readily-available inexpensive adhesives is recommended, provided that they can
              |        develop the shear strength of the paper, the paper-gypsum interface, or the
              |        gypsum.

text          | Experiments on gypsum-to-gypsum panel edge joints showed that joints enhanced with a
              | stronger compound and fiberglass tape can produce connections about twice as strong as
              | conventional gypsum edge joints composed of paper joint tape and a pre-mixed joint
              | compound. Since both connections reached ultimate strength capacities when the
              | compound cracked, it is believed this strength increase is mostly due to the joint
              | compound, as opposed to the tape. The enhanced gypsum joint compound was composed
              | of a conventional powder compound hydrated with three parts water and one part
              | concrete bonding adhesive. For flat gypsum joints, presence of blocking had the effect of
              | increasing strength by about 20%, while greatly increasing joint ductility after failure of

text          | the compound. These enhancements were found to be much more effective for flat
              | gypsum joints than corner joints because joint penetration with the compound was more
              | easily accomplished. In fact, no significant difference in joint strength and stiffness was
              | observed for enhanced corner joints when compared to conventional corner joints.

text          | Additional conclusions from this series of experiments are:
blank         | 
text          |       Both conventional and improved panel edge connections displayed very high
              |        stiffness until the joint compound cracked.
              |       When no blocking was used, gypsum joints subjected to pure shear were about
              |        10-20% stronger than those subjected to a combination of bending and shear.
              |        When blocking was included, the strength was about the same for the joints with
              |        and without bending permitted across the joint.
              |       Damage to joints first occurred near ultimate loading when a crack developed
              |        across the joint. At larger levels of deformation, fiberglass mesh tape continued to
              |        provide joint resistance, whereas the paper joint tapes easily tore. Prior to ultimate
              |        loading, which corresponded to cracking at the joints, both joint types showed no
              |        signs of damage.

text          | Experimental testing of dowel stucco-to-wood fasteners showed that the diameter and

              |        gypsum and the other included enhanced stucco on enhanced glass mat gypsum
              |        sheathing were twice as strong, but only modestly stiffer than two-sided enhanced
              |        gypsum connections. Damage to the gypsum connections was visible at forces
              |        about half that of the enhanced two-sided stucco-gypsum connections.
              |       Stucco connections usually failed by the stucco panel pulling off of the dowel

title         | Light-frame gypsum and stucco wall tests
blank         | 
text          | A series of small scale and full-scale (Hopkins et al. 2014) strength- and stiffness-
              | enhanced light frame gypsum and stucco walls were tested. Gypsum walls with adhesive
              | connections were found to be nearly twice as strong and two to four times as stiff as
              | conventional drywall sheathed walls. Use of enhanced screw fasteners in light-frame
              | gypsum wall construction only modestly increased wall racking strength and stiffness
              | when compared to walls with conventional drywall screws. Using construction adhesives
              | in addition to screw fasteners to connect wallboard to framing increased wall racking
              | strength by a factor of two while increasing initial wall racking stiffness by two to four
              | times. Enhanced walls with adhesive-applied gypsum on the interior and stucco
              | connected with large screws on the other reached strengths almost twice that of the
              | enhanced gypsum walls. As with the fastener tests, the use of adhesives provided a
              | racking force-displacement relationship that was nearly linear until the adhesive began to
              | fail. Walls built with only screw fasteners displayed highly nonlinear behavior even at

text          | Additional conclusions from these experiments include:
blank         | 
text          |       Peak strength was reached at wall drifts of about 0.25% for walls built with
              |        adhesives, whereas walls built with dowel fasteners only reached peak strength at
              |        drift levels of 1% to 2%.
              |       Observable damage started at wall drifts of about 0.2%, with cracking and
              |        indentation around perimeter screw fasteners.
              |       At large levels of deformation (>2.0%), the gypsum panels separated from the
              |        framing along the wall perimeter.
              |       Damage to adhesive connections was not always observable during testing
              |        because the connection would fail by pulling the back of the gypsum paper off of
              |        the panel, leaving the gypsum surface intact. This is a factor to consider when
              |        inspecting a home after a seismic event where peak deformations were between
              |        0.2% and 0.4% as there may be hidden damage in some locations (especially in
              |        the perimeter of the walls).
              |       Walls built with wood framing were about 10-20% stronger and stiffer than
              |        comparable walls built with cold-formed steel framing. This difference could be
              |        ascribed to the stronger adhesion to the wood framing as opposed to the cold-
              |        formed steel surface. Additionally, the cold-formed steel members used are about
              |        8% narrower than the wood members, providing a reduced contact area for
              |        adhesive.

              |        compared to cyclically tested wall specimens.
              |       The increase in wall ductility and stiffness due to wall end returns was captured
              |        well with finite element models, though the reloading stiffness degradation
              |        observed in testing was not fully captured due to lack of test data characterizing
              |        damage mechanisms in wall end returns.
              |       The onset and progression of damage in light-frame walls could be tracked well
              |        by studying the sheathing stress distributions in finite element models. Sudden
              |        decreases in sheathing stresses indicated damage to sheathing-to-framing
              |        fasteners in adjacent locations.
              |       Through detailed finite element modeling of enhanced light-frame walls, the wall
              |        aspect (height-to-width) ratio was found to dramatically affect unit wall stiffness.
              |        However, aspect ratio did not have much effect on unit strength, except in cases
              |        where hold-down devices were not provided. The presence of hold-down devices
              |        was found to significantly affect both wall strength and stiffness, especially for
              |        walls with large aspect ratios.
              |       The high-fidelity nonlinear finite element wall models often experienced
              |        convergence problems, especially as peak loading was being reached. This is due
              |        to the loss of strength that occurs quite rapidly after the peak force is reached. In
              |        some cases, the post-capping displacement of element (e.g., in walls with
              |        adhesive) was increased slightly to allow for convergence. These models also

text          | To aid in the design of strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures, an elastic
              | analysis method was proposed, which uses the software ETABS to model walls as shell
              | elements that resist loads in- and out-of-plane. Since the total stiffness of shell elements
              | loaded in-plane is a function of shear and bending stiffness, stiffness modifiers were

title         | 9.2.4 Design methodology for enhanced light-frame structures
blank         | 
text          | A modal analysis design approach, including both stiffness and strength checks, was
              | developed for enhanced light-frame systems with the goal of limiting damage and
              | providing near-elastic performance under the design earthquake. The method is primarily
              | based on limiting wall drifts to 0.2% under design level earthquake loads. The design
              | approach provides minimum floor strengths and stiffnesses at each floor based on a
              | lumped-mass modal analysis. For one-, two-, and some three-story structures with regular
              | geometries, tabulated values are provided to determine the required strength and stiffness
              | in each story. The required story strength and stiffness values are dependent on the mass
              | distribution between floors. The requirements are often met by typical wall layouts that
              | are determined by building functionality requirements. This method requires all enhanced
              | light-frame wall segments that are considered to resist lateral loads to include appropriate
              | hold-down devices. Equations to estimate the strength and lateral stiffness of enhanced
              | light-frame walls, including the stiffness of hold-downs and the effect of perforations,
              | were developed. The design method is carried out by producing a prototype floor plan,
              | estimating wall strengths and stiffnesses, calculating required wall strengths and
              | stiffnesses, then adjusting the floor plan and wall layout until the provided strengths and
              | stiffnesses exceed the minimum requirements. An alternative force-based approach was
              | also presented, where an equivalent lateral force profile is applied to the structure
              | considering R=1, and wall forces and drifts checked. The proposed design procedures
              | were illustrated with the design of an enhanced two-story wood-framed structure. The
              | floor plans of an index one- and three-story wood framed structure were presented and
              | the estimated location and length of enhanced walls were shown. Meeting the design
              | requirements without requiring many walls in lower floors may become difficult for taller
              | light-frame buildings as strength must be provided to keep walls on all floors nearly
              | elastic under the design earthquake loading scenario. In cases where this enough wall

title         | 9.2.5 Sliding base isolation parametric study for light-frame structures
blank         | 
text          | A parametric study of sliding base isolation systems for light-frame structures was carried
              | out for application to strength- and stiffness-enhanced structures in near fault areas. In the
              | study, the friction coefficient, restoring stiffness, and supplemental viscous damping
              | applied to a SDOF system were varied to investigate the effect of these parameters on
              | system response. A set of bi-directional motions were scaled to the MCE level of shaking
              | and applied to each system. Increasing the friction coefficient and viscous damping
              | provided to an isolation system were effective in decreasing peak isolation displacement,
              | while providing restoring stiffness decreased residual displacements. Since providing
              | supplemental damping and increasing the coefficient of friction had similar effects on
              | isolation response, it was determined that the friction alone is a practical and economical
              | way to limit isolation drifts, so as to avoid the cost of supplemental damping devices.
              | Providing even modest levels of restoring stiffness was found to greatly reduce the
              | residual displacement of the isolation system, while also slightly reducing the peak
              | isolator displacement. For strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame systems that can
              | sustain relatively large base shear demands without damage, a sliding system with a
              | friction coefficient of about 0.2 to 0.3 is suggested, with a restoring stiffness of about
              | 0.05% per mm of displacement provided (e.g., 5.0 kN/cm for a 1000 kN sliding mass or a
              | sliding radius of curvature of 2 m). A sliding system with these parameters was found to
              | limit peak displacements to about 30 cm, while restoring the structure to within about 5
              | cm when subjected to the MCE motions. The base shear transferred into the
              | superstructure is limited to about 35% of the superstructure weight, which is well within
              | tolerable limits for strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures.

              |        probability of collapse under the MCE. The collapse margin ratio for the
              |        enhanced house was about 8% larger than that of the conventional house
              |        considering finishes and 30% larger than the conventional house without
              |        considering finishes.
              |       Using MSA, the median spectral acceleration causing initial damage in the

              |        respectively. This corresponds to a drift limit of 0.2%, at which faster damage and
              |        cracking has been observed to initiate in light-frame gypsum and stucco walls.

text          | The two-story prototype houses were also subjected to the FEMA P695 procedure and
              | MSA when two sliding isolation systems were provided. One system included a house
              | sliding on twelve flat friction isolators, while the other system utilized twelve dish-
              | shaped isolators with a radius of curvature of 2.0 m. The dish-shaped isolators are
              | intended to provide self-centering following ground shaking with an equivalent restoring
              | stiffness of 2.25 kN/cm. The velocity friction coefficient of both sliding systems was
              | about 0.17, representing the dynamic friction coefficient of HDPE on galvanized steel.
              | Failure of the isolation system is defined as when the peak isolator displacement exceeds
              | the size of the plate on which the HDPE pad is sliding. This failure would result in the
              | structure sliding onto the ground, however this likely would not cause structural collapse.
              | As such, the collapse probability was not calculated for these isolated structures. It was
              | found that the probability of exceeding the allowable isolator sliding displacement of 36
              | cm (14 in) in fifty years for the prototype house was about 2% and 1% for the house on
              | flat and dish-shaped isolators, respectively. This probability is somewhat larger than the
              | probability of collapse for the strength- and stiffness-enhanced structure without
              | isolation. This probability of isolation failure could be reduced by increasing the size of
              | the sliding plate or by increasing the friction coefficient of the sliders used by using a
              | different sliding material on the steel plates, possibly polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).
              | Alternatively, a bumper system could be installed to help mitigate the consequence of
              | excessive isolator displacement. When using both flat and dish-shaped isolators, the peak
              | drifts in the superstructure were less than about 0.1% and would likely not cause
              | observable damage to walls and diaphragms when the structure slides within the

              | walls with adhesive-applied gypsum on one side and strengthened stucco on the other
              | (stucco-gypsum) were studied separately in different archetype models. One-, two-, and
              | three-story structures were studied as well as two-story simplified archetypes with
              | different mass and wall stiffness distributions between floor levels. Using the FEMA
              | P695 (2009) methodology, it was found that the collapse margin ratios of the simplified
              | archetypes built with stucco-gypsum walls were about twice those of buildings
              | constructed with enhanced gypsum-gypsum walls only. Since the walls were designed
              | with the same design strengths, the difference is primarily due to the larger inelastic
              | overstrength and ductility in the stucco walls. The collapse margin ratios of the simplified
              | archetypes with gypsum-gypsum walls are on the cusp of meeting the requirements for a
              | 10% probability of collapse in 50 years in many cases, and meet the requirements for a
              | 20% probability of collapse in 50 years in all cases. The stucco-gypsum simplified
              | archetypes provided ample collapse safety in all cases. Since these simplified archetypes
              | did not include realistic floor plans and extra wall lengths that would likely be included in
              | fully designed archetypes, further investigations are necessary. The collapse margin ratio
              | of the archetype structures was not found to be sensitive to the mass and stiffness
              | distribution between the floor levels. The collapse margin ratio was found to reduce

              | investigated to determine how these variables affect model performance under the FEMA
              | P695 and MSA procedures. If the collapse capacity of enhanced light-frame buildings
              | with only gypsum walls needs to be improved, the design strength or R-factor could be

text          | Though a performance-based collapse assessment of a prototype two-story enhanced
              | light-frame structure with and without base isolation was performed, a more
              | comprehensive evaluation of building type response should be performed by developing
              | many additional structural archetypes with realistic floor plans belonging to various
              | performance groups including both residential and small commercial structures. This
              | comprehensive approach would meet the requirements set forth in FEMA P695 (2009).
              | This evaluation would ensure the collapse safety of enhanced light-frame structures is
              | provided to buildings with widely varying heights and floor plans. In addition to
              | providing information regarding the collapse performance of the archetype structures,
              | this analysis would indicate if the design requirements provide roughly uniform drift and

text          | The performed performance-based analysis could be further extended to calculate losses

              | the repair and replacement cost of these components at different damage levels. This

title         | 9.4 Concluding remarks
text          | This work contributes to the development and understanding of enhanced light-frame
              | components, walls, and structures through concept development, experimental testing,
              | analytical model formulation, design procedure creation, and building system
              | performance validation. The results of this research should be considered along with the
              | limitations inherent in this study. This work provides promising results indicating that
              | strength- and stiffness-enhanced light-frame structures can significantly limit the damage

text          | incurred in light-frame structures exposed to seismic hazards while still providing
              | adequate collapse safety under less frequent, extreme earthquakes. Additionally, this
              | study has indicated that the use of an inexpensive base isolation system for light-frame
              | structures may be effective in further limiting or totally eliminating structural damage to
              | light-frame structures even in areas near faults where seismic intensities may be too large
              | to implement the strength- and stiffness-enhancements alone. However, further work is
              | needed to quantify modeling uncertainty and study the performance of light-frame
              | structures of differing geometries.

              | component and wall test data
              | In Section 3.1, a series of experimental tests for light-frame fasteners and connections
              | were discussed. While the test results cited were representative of all performed, the data
              | from each test was not presented explicitly for brevity. For some experiments, parameters
              | such as the peak strength and stiffness were noted, but the force-displacement behavior
              | and other details of component response were omitted. In this section the behavior of
              | each tested gypsum and stucco component specimen is presented. This full series of
              | component tests includes 64 screw and adhesive gypsum-to-framing specimens, 26
              | gypsum-to-gypsum panel joint tests, and 10 stucco dowel fastener tests.

text          | In total, 42 gypsum-to-wood and 10 gypsum-to-steel fastener connections were tested at
              | Stanford University. Two cyclic loading protocols were used in gypsum fastener testing
              | in addition to a monotonic protocol. The first cyclic protocol used was the CUREE-
              | Caltech protocol (Krawinkler et al. 2001) and the second was a protocol devised to
              | impose more displacement amplitude steps and cycles at small levels of deformation.
              | This protocol was meant so simulate repeated reverse small amplitude loading, which
              | may be expected in components with short periods subjected to long duration ground

title         | A.3 Dowel stucco-to-wood framing connection tests
text          | In Section 3.3, a series of stucco-to-framing dowel fastener tests were presented. The
              | complete tests data is shown in this section. Figure A.63 through Figure A.67 show the
              | force-displacement response of all stucco-to-wood framing connections tested. The final
              | set of experiments (Figure A.67) includes connections with enhanced stucco on a glass
              | mat gypsum substrate on one side with adhesive-enhanced stucco on the other. The other
              | connection tests included only dowel stucco-to-framing connections with no substrate.

title         | A.4 Small scale gypsum wall tests
text          | In Chapter 4, a series of small scale (2.4 m square) wall tests performed at Stanford were
              | discussed. The strength and initial stiffness of all tested walls can be found in Table 4.1.
              | The data from each of those tests is presented in this section. The force-displacement
              | behavior of the conventional and enhanced gypsum walls on both wood and cold-formed
              | steel framing are shown in Figure A.68 through Figure A.72. The cyclic envelope and
              | energy dissipation curves from these tested specimens are presented in Figure A.73
              | through Figure A.77.

title         | Three-dimensional modal design
              | procedure
text          | The modal design procedure in Section 6.3 describes the analysis of a light-frame
              | structure where torsional effects are minimal. That type of analysis is appropriate for
              | buildings where the center of rigidity (stiffness) lies near the center of mass on each floor.
              | For cases where this distance is more than about 20% of the building dimension for a
              | given floor and direction, a three-dimensional modal analysis must be performed to fully
              | capture the torsional effects that may exist in the building. This three-dimensional modal
              | analysis including torsion is described in this section.

title         | B.1 Elastic modal analysis considering three-

text          | In analyzing light-frame structures where torsional effects are minimal, the modal
              | analysis described in Section 6.3 assumes that only two uncoupled translational degrees
              | of freedom exist at each floor level. When torsion is significant, a third rotational degree
              | of freedom is required to capture the displacement amplification seen in some walls due
              | to torsion. A free body figure of a two-story structure where torsion exists is shown in
              | Figure B.1.

title         | B.2 Example design of enhanced two-story house
text          | This updated three-dimensional modal analysis considering torsion was applied to the
              | two-story house archetype described in Section 6.6. The same design level modal
              | analysis was applied to this model as was used in the models that did not consider
              | torsion. The wall drifts and normalized shear demands calculated for each wall are shown
              | in Table B.1. Using this procedure, the wall shear demands are met in all walls in the
              | house, except one, an exterior wall on the first floor in the transverse direction. However,
              | the normalized strength demand is only 3% larger than the design strength. The drift in
              | that same wall also exceeds the drift limit of 0.2%. However, since three-dimensional
              | modal analysis of the model structure using ETABS showed that all walls met design
              | strength and stiffness requirements (Table 6.33), the house design may be considered
              | conforming according to the design procedure.
