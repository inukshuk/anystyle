title         |                                    ABSTRACT

              | 
text          |       Design, construction, and operation of very large, complex aerospace systems
              | (mega-systems) is challenging, with potential cost and schedule over-runs and with
              | awkward upgrade issues. These challenges are amplified when the engineering
              | organization is producing multiple mega-systems in parallel. This dissertation applies
              | information theory, genetic computing, and chaos theory to product development within a
              | large distributed organization. The goal is design environments that efficiently produce
              | mega-systems that are better able to evolve within the changing world context.
              |       Complex systems are composed of dynamically interacting pieces that exhibit
              | emergent behaviours as a result of their growth and/or the passage of time. Modern large
              | engineered systems (~10,000+ man-years of design time), such as the American Air
              | Traffic Control System and International Space Station, exhibit complex behaviour over
              | their life, including design, installation, operation, and growth. The desired capability of
              | the systems is so complex that it is difficult and time consuming to consistently specify
              | detail for what is desired. The installation and operation of the complex systems changes
              | the environment in which they are installed, creating a continuously changing context for
              | follow-on and adjunct system requirements. Finally, maintenance and growth
              | characteristics for complex systems, including new adjunct systems, exhibit various
              | levels of brittleness.
              |       This dissertation develops a new type of model to analyze the design and
              | construction of mega-systems, based on combining an organization network-model with
              | an information-transfer link-model. Analysis of previous efforts within the Design
              | Research and the System Engineering communities shows three major shortcomings:
              | they assume efficient network connectivity, they assume static networks, and they
              | assume loss-less data transfer. A new model type is developed and exercised to examine
              | methods and techniques to improve mega-system design and construction, and then
              | validated in a three-year experiment implementing an enterprise product delivery process.
              | Model development is based on data from US aerospace companies and programs
              | spanning the last 30 years.

text          |      The design of complex systems is not a linear, mechanistic process, but rather a
              | multi-dimensional, growth process that can be cultivated over and above the analytical
              | disciplines of design and optimization. The duality of a complex system designing a
              | complex system reduces determinism. This dissertation identifies parameters of
              | information exchange activities that can be adjusted to produce an efficient, successful
              | outcome, albeit a non-deterministic outcome. This adjustment or shaping is similar to
              | guided genetic evolution of organizations that produce mega-systems as the product of
              | their computation, but within a restricted context of specified, but evolving, goals and
              | constraints.
              |      This new analytical framework shows how to match information flow
              | characteristics to emergent engineering activities to improve the efficiency and quality of
              | the design process, and to improve the efficiency and coupling of research and
              | development activities within the larger organization. Information flow must not be
              | confused with data transfer. Information flow parameters include information resolution,
              | variability, time scale, compression, link bandwidth, connectivity maps, and more. For
              | instance, simply avoiding information aliasing in chaotic channels by matching the flow
              | to the information aging rate can improve design efficiency 80% and product delivery
              | efficiency 50% in the overall steady state.
              |      The implication of these results is a radical improvement in procurement of large
              | systems. However, inherent linkages to government organizations that typically fund
              | these large scale projects require a dual adaptation approach similar to meta-norms in
              | game theory. Otherwise, the emergent properties of efficient engineering management
              | will cause a reversion to a lower level of capability per status quo. Also, in order to
              | support the greater output rate, mega-system specifications will become somewhat non-
              | deterministic and delivery will rely inherently on product engineering, requiring a change
              | in perspective of program management. This is beneficial evolution of the organization
              | to improve delivery, and the total value delivered to society will accrue at higher
              | compound growth rates.

text          | Engineers propose to understand canonical mechanisms and prototypical behaviours to
              | better control the systems development effort. But you cannot control a complex system
              | in which you are immersed, and within an environmental context that changes before
              | your controls can respond. You must cultivate and guide these systems at various and
              | appropriate time scales.

text          | This dissertation develops a new type of model to analyze the design and construction of
              | mega-systems, based on combining an organization network-model with an information-
              | transfer link-model. This combined model is exercised to examine methods and
              | techniques to improve mega-system design and construction, and then validated in a
              | three-year experiment implementing an enterprise product delivery process. Model
              | development is based on data from US aerospace companies and programs spanning the
              | last 30 years.

text          | Previous efforts within the Design Research and the System Engineering communities to
              | analyze and improve Engineering Processes that are used to design mega-systems are
              | summarized in Appendix A. Analysis of these recent efforts shows three major
              | shortcomings: they assume efficient network connectivity, they assume static networks,
              | and they assume loss-less data transfer. This dissertation is a first step toward correcting
              | these deficiencies, and accounting for these very real constraints.

title         | 1.1 Problem
text          | Large Complex Mega-Systems are defined here as efforts that span 10 years of
              | development time (design and production) and require 10,000 man-years of effort.
              | Typically engineers are drawn from a wide supply chain spanning a large geographic
              | area. These systems include the NASA Space Shuttle, the International Space Station
              | (ISS), and planned Mars and asteroid missions (Figure 1-1). Terrestrial examples include
              | the Air Traffic Control Systems (ATCS), missile defense systems, nuclear power plants,
              | and others.

text          | Problems arise when developing these systems, likely caused by their immense scale.
              | Some systems are never built, or take a much longer time than planned before the design
              | is finalized for production: this is sometimes caused by requirements churn such as for
              | the ISS and its precursors. Other systems exhibit upgrade brittleness such as the ATCS:
              | here, because of either the safety requirements, distributed nature, or necessary
              | incremental approach to upgrades, the follow-on replacement design was unable to close
              | and had to be restarted several times at great expense. Some products collide with
              | obsolescence issues since their design process takes so long that some of the originally
              | included components are no longer available.

              |                         Mega-Systems are designed by Mega-Organizations that have tens of thousands of
              |                         engineers spread widely across a large geographic area. Organizations are treated here as

              |                         organizational network model is developed in Section 2.0 as summarized in Figure 1-2.

text          |                         The design-organization network model represents a distributed mega-design-community
              |                         of 100,000 people producing a set of mega-systems over time. These people are
              |                         assembled into various organizations including design groups, project teams, discipline
              |                         departments, support functions, small businesses, etc. Each organizational group, or
              |                         node, is composed of many people, and there may be multiple instances of any one
              |                         group. The variety of people within each node provides a diverse set of capabilities to

title         | 1.3 Information Transfer and Link Model
text          | Earlier efforts in modeling multi-scale organizations with emergent properties [Byler
              | 2000] showed the critical nature of multi-scale communications. Following an Adaptive
              | Non-linear Testing technique [Miller 2007], the modeling validation and verification
              | indicated massive instability around the parameters defining “communicativity”. This
              | defined a critical area of investigation explored further in this dissertation.

              | 
text          | “Communicativity” is related to the number, speed, and bandwidth of connections
              | between agents. For individual design agents this is related, for example, to the number
              | of emails sent per day, the number of addressees in an agents personal address book,
              | number of off-site web-page accesses, typical phone usage, etc. For design groups, this is
              | related to frequency and size of design reviews, availability and type of online design
              | storage, geographic separation (bull-pen vs. cubicles), etc. For project swarms (groups,
              | departments, small businesses), “communicativity” is rate of engineer reassignment, size
              | and quality of information system network, frequency of training, and whether the project
              | is owned by the company or someone else (which implies internalization of requirements
              | and operations).

              | model for the network links was developed to better include factors addressing
              | communications parameters as well as organization parameters, functional activities, and

text          | For the organization model developed here (Section 1.2 and 2.0), each node is an agent

              | [Petrie 1996]. Agents can be individuals, groups, organizations, or other complices.

text          | Each agent performs its function using a variety of people or skills. Producing a

              | analyst. Then the product must be packaged and delivered. If one considers the

              | activities, but rather by how much work must be done to understand or incorporate
              | (receive and decode) the material being transmitted by the input agent. The effect of the

text          | Model parameters were developed for each link in the organization model. Multiple
              | parameters are summarized into a value for product information characteristics ‘p’, and
              | for transmission characteristics ‘a’, for each link. Several of these are shown in Figure
              | 1-6 to highlight cases of interest. The product information aliasing factor ‘p’, has been
              | placed into three bins: (s) small (1-2), (m) medium (3), and (l) large (4-6). The
              | environmental transmission/transfer rate is represented by ‘a’. (Note that ‘a’ is non-
              | continuous, and has a reverse scale compared to ‘p’ (see Sections 3.4.2 and 4.2).)

              | External goals and specifications, combined with our quasi, scale-free network, create directed links

              | Numbered blue lines are directed link paths; red numbers are total aliasing factors (TAF) (section
              | 3.4.4). These link-chains need to be evaluated to make sure the information arrives timely and un-
              | corrupted. Corruption can be caused by aliasing, occurring either during variety compression /
              | decoding, or from multi-scale time-aliasing. Case (2), the delivery of new Research products into
              | large Programs, has the highest TAF corruption factor of 15.

title         | 1.5 Conclusions
text          | This dissertation developed a new type of model for extremely large design organizations
              | and their environment by combining perspectives from:
              |         -   evolutionary genetic computing organisms,
              |         -   information theoretic (quantum) information production, and
              |         -   non-linear dynamics and chaos theory for information exchange.
              | to study some of the behaviours of complex organizations, especially information
              | transfer, to show how organizations can be guided to more efficiently and quickly
              | produce complex mega-systems.

              | 
text          | A three-year experiment was performed within a large design organization to see what
              | level and type of improvements would actually manifest.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | The results fall into three categories:
              |         -   production of individual mega-systems,
              |         -   improvement in organizations that develop mega-systems, and
              |         -   extraction of societal benefits from government funded mega-systems.
              | These are addressed separately below.

title         | 1.5.1 Design of Individual Mega-Systems
text          | Mismatched quality of information transfer among organizational elements causes
              | significant inefficiencies. The transfer quality includes time synchronization, method of
              | transfer, and other variables. It is not that anything is currently wrong, just that a lot of
              | time is wasted waiting for information, translating information, or re-developing the
              | context to understand the information. Also, additional time (and resources) may be
              | spent waiting for task convergence at a higher level. Matching the characteristics of the
              | product design information to the characteristics of the transfer path minimizes aliasing
              | effects (dissipation and noise), creating many benefits including:

title         | 1.5.2 Company and Design-Organization Implications
text          | Improvements in the performance of the organization will incrementally emerge, given
              | the inertia of large organizations and of engineering processes, and will initially manifest
              | as quicker mega-system deliveries and an accelerating ability to innovate ahead of other
              | companies.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | “One consequence of encoding information as statistical and time-varying patterns of
              | low-level components is that no individual component of the system can perceive or
              | communicate the ‘big-picture’ of the state of the system. Instead, information must be
              | communicated via spatial and temporal sampling.” [Mitchell 2009] Dynamically, the
              | mega-design process is progressing, and any snapshot is an incomplete view in a
              | changing context. This implies that the product directors exert little real control on where
              | the company is going. Their actual role is simply to monitor the outputs and nascent
              | products, and to guide the output (and rate of new product introduction and of upgrades)
              | to match the funding (requirements) source.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | This dynamic perspective implies that design communities can, and should, “construct
              | their own [evolutionary] selective constructs designed toward increasing mutual
              | information [within itself, and] between the organism and the environment” [Krakauer
              | 2011], for better computability or production of designs (cf. niche construction). In this

              | information transfer efficiencies, in addition to process control (like design reviews),
              | because looking at static variables will not improve the evolutionary adaptation rate.

title         | 1.5.3 Government and Societal Implications
text          | The stability of any implemented improvements is somewhat problematic given the
              | evolving environment, but especially given the counter-acting efforts of government
              | acquisition regulations and nominal management tendencies.

text          | Scale, synchronization, and economic nudges may be appropriate for personal scale
              | complices such as smartPhone apps, but the economic and scale factors are different from
              | government “apps”. A focus on lowest cost procurement, for government “apps” (mega-
              | systems), has side effects on the engineering design process. Financially speaking, and
              | for more effective mega-system development, the government should modify cost-
              | selection constraints to avoid extra effort to achieve a particular instance when any of a
              | set of instances is all that is needed. This would necessarily become somewhat non-
              | deterministic.

              | 
text          | Individual program managers will avoid this because it is locally inefficient and also
              | uncontrollable. However, according to game theory (prisoner’s dilemma [Morrow
              | 1994]), a Pareto optimal solution is better, and can be achieved with “external norms”
              | [Mitchell 2009]. The external norms could either be via company processes and
              | procedures or, better, by the government’s Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
blank         | 
              | 
text          | For instance, implementation at the government FAR level could be to assign 1% - 2% of
              | the value of programs over a certain size to internal efforts supporting adaptability and
              | risk reduction. For instance the Orion spacecraft program internally allocated $100M
              | (for a $4B program) to reduce schedule risk occurring from software integration. This is
              | the same scale as proposed, and was considered and approved as the correct engineering
              | approach. However, it was implemented without adjusting the encompassing process, so

              | risk on the delivery of the initial system, and reduce cost of subsequent systems.

text          | Such a fund could also be allocated for application to follow-on project development, and

title         | 2.1 Structure of Very Large Aerospace Design Communities
text          | Large aerospace companies typically have on the order of (100,000) employees, of whom
              | (50%) are engineers and scientists of various sorts. These organizations typically have a
              | large number of entwined organizations to produce and deliver their platforms.

              | 
text          | Aerospace companies might be divided into (five) business areas or sectors to address
              | different market areas. An upper-level corporate organization might provide common
              | resources for business development, common research, common engineering tools and
              | process, and other functions.

text          | For our purposes we will discuss a medium sized space company (sector) of ($10B)
              | annual sales. Companies are divided into lines of business or business units on the scale
              | of ($1B) annual sales. The (10) business units are the major components of the company

text          | Our prototypical medium sized space company has on the order of (20,000) employees.
              | The (10,000) engineers frequently reside in an Engineering home-shop organization that
              | may span (10) disciplines, each with a Discipline Director. The goal of the Engineering
              | home-shops is to have 99.9% of their staff assigned to a Program where they are
              | developing deliverable products and profit. Each business unit would then have about
              | (1000) engineers and (2000) total staff. Engineering frequently has some small number
              | of senior engineering staff who coordinates Tools and processes.

text          | In our model of this aerospace organization or community, there are many overlapping
              | hierarchies. First there are the five different Business Units that are controlled by upper-
              | level corporate organization that supplies common resources. In parallel, there are also
              | functional hierarchies such as for Engineering disciplines, Finance, Research, Quality
              | Control, etc. Finally, there are additional parallel hierarchies for business management,
              | Program control and engineering process control.

text          | Hierarchical systems are difficult to scale. Single points of control can’t digest enough
              | information to quickly process the next step in the organization’s computation. You need
              | more information and more coordination among the larger team for goal-oriented, “feed-
              | forward” information to achieve timely efficiency. Also, hierarchies tend to create walls,
              | and by creating separate groups, you create (evolutionary) sub-populations which both
              | cannot process as much as the whole, but also compete with each other internally.
              | Finally, when the sub-populations ‘die’, they lose their knowledge/information; and when
              | larger groups “die”, they even lose their assets (like the international space station).

text          | For single systems with limited levels of control, both efficient performance and task
              | execution stability can be achieved. For larger systems, both stability and performance
              | degrade with scale (Figure 2-6 and Figure 2-7). In very large product development
              | networks (see section 3.3.2) networks can lose convergence, and tasks never complete.

text          | Cross connections within social systems are natural, and engineering design communities
              | have also evolved into ‘neural’ communities. Intuitively, this is good because they are
              | better able to compute their products. This is because of the extra information available
              | from peer groups (related to ‘a’ as defined in Section 3.0). The quicker computation rates
              | let the group/community evolve better because of broader scope and more agility. Thus
              | the community organism competes better.

text          | In the context of network theory a scale-free ideal network is a random network with a
              | degree distribution a power law, at least asymptotically. That is, the fraction P(k) of
              | nodes in the network having k connections to other nodes goes for large values of k as

text          | The most notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of
              | vertices with a degree that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are
              | often called "hubs". The scale-free property also strongly correlates with the network's
              | robustness to failure.

              | 
text          | Another important characteristic of scale-free networks is the clustering coefficient
              | distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows
              | a power law. This implies that the low-degree nodes belong to very dense sub-graphs and
              | those sub-graphs are connected to each other through hubs.

text          | Consider a social network in which nodes are people and links are acquaintance
              | relationships between people. It is easy to see that people tend to form communities, i.e.,
              | small groups in which everyone knows everyone (one can think of such community as a
              | complete graph). In addition, the members of a community also have a few acquaintance
              | relationships to people outside that community. Some people, however, are connected to
              | a large number of communities (e.g., celebrities, politicians). Those people may be
              | considered the hubs responsible for the small-world phenomenon. [Wikkipedia]

text          | In our abstracted organizational model, the information from Figure 2-3 has been
              | collapsed into two dimensions for display clarity and in order to focus on the
              | multidimensional parameters. The links are multi-dimensional themselves, including
              | characteristics on communication I/O dispersion, types of information carried, etc.
              | Likewise, the links are not necessarily singular stages, but can encompass multiple steps.
              | Extraction and development of these organizational parameters and link characteristics
              | are discussed in detail in Section 3.0.

title         | 3.1 Model Overview
text          | For the organization model developed here (Section 2.0), each node is an agent composed
              | of many people. Agents can be individuals, design groups, project swarms, or other
              | complices. These agents are peer-to-peer agents in a weak sense as defined by Petrie
              | [Petrie 1996]. In this sense they are true agents that provide generation of new
              | information, but they are weak in that they do not use standard protocols for
              | communication. Each agent’s protocols (methods) are particular to that set of agents.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Each agent performs its function using a variety of people or skills. Producing a
              | controller card, for instance, may require a machinist, a programmer, and a financial
              | analyst. Then the product must be packaged and delivered. If one considers the
              | controller card as inherently containing the design and product information, then the
              | output could be termed to be encoded and transmitted, similar to packaged and delivered.

              | activities, but rather by how much work must be done to understand or incorporate
              | (receive and decode) the material being transmitted by the input agent. The effect of the
              | design environment includes how the information is stored (transmission is not

title         | 3.2.1 Information in Design Communities
text          | For our quasi-scale-free engineering design community (Section 2.0), “information”
              | includes the material acquired and developed to further the knowledge base, the product
              | design, and the integration, assembly and test of the output products. This includes point
              | design descriptions, experimental results, performance measurements, reports,
              | spreadsheets, technologies, CNC tapes, test sequences, manufacturing tolerances,
              | fabrication techniques, etc.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | This “information” accumulates over time and is applied to design and produce new
              | products. Our engineering community actually produces a portfolio of products
              | including evolutionary products, new products in current markets, current products in
              | new markets, and occasionally new products for new markets. There is an ongoing,
              | evolving set of core competencies within each design community that, when infused with
              | new information, allow the product stream to adapt to the changing market
              | (environment). This design community produces some number of mega-systems in
              | parallel efforts (but offset in time).

text          | In Figure 3-2, there are several major groups whose development products are roughly
              | summarized below (capitalized terms symbolically represent their definition). Programs
              | create the major output of our design community – an Operational System that takes 12
              | years to design, produce, integrate and test. Programs are controlled by Program
              | Management; this group coordinates several large projects, and is driven by a (typical)
              | three-year Long Range Plan (LRP). The internal information packages within Program
              | Management support the activity around successfully executing LRPs (not the program).
              | Creation of LRPs is guided by Business Development who operates on a one-year cycle,
              | based on accounting cycles including the government budgetary process. Research
              | groups typically operate on one-year cycles also, based on an internal budget allocation
              | cycle. Research reports are published and filed annually, and other internal information
              | products support these efforts. Research groups frequently develop new Prototype
              | Systems to demonstrate new capabilities to Program Management. These might take two
              | years to develop.

blank         | 
              | 
text          | A separate explicit infrastructure however becomes problematic, especially on projects
              | with long time scales (~10 years). Issues arise that interfere with having a consistent
              | structure. The portfolio of projects across a large organization use different engineering
              | tools. This will always be true because of a mismatch of time frequencies between new
              | tools and new projects, and the fact you can’t and don’t want to update your tools all at
              | once on a preordained schedule. Also actors bring different sets of tool knowledge with
              | them to each activity. It actually takes some finite time for a team to get synchronized on
              | common tools and data structures. Much training is completed on the job, with no
              | separate time allotment and no separate instructors, with the result that tools are not
              | always used as they were designed, nor to their full potential. Finally, retrieval of old
              | knowledge becomes problematic and time consuming, and may become moot as different
              | technologies advance at different rates, opening up new solution spaces for consideration.

              | retrieval is that engineering team members do not always follow a project from

              | Typically, engineers focus on one stage of design. As a result the information associated

title         | 3.2.3 Product Entropy and Information Packages
text          | In discussing information content (I(x)) as opposed to information transfer, the entropy
              | (information) level of a possible conceptual design is very high in that there are a very
              | large number of ways the design could be implemented; different functions included;
              | different materials used; different reliabilities; etc. The entropy level of a completed
              | product is close to zero in that the design is frozen. This “zero” entropy is a relative
              | value since there is still myriad flexibility in subsequent product use, in product
              | combinations, etc. (Figure 3-3).

              | Entropy (s) is very large when a design problem starts. As decisions are made, materials chosen,
              | and functionality included, entropy is reduced until there is no flexibility (s = 0) in the final
              | product. At an earlier preliminary design stage (s > 0), there is flexibility in the design to create
              | different possible variants. The set of possible variants is a Hilbert space.

text          | Likewise the entropy of a new technology or technique is very large. This new material
              | or new processor could be used in thousands of different products; the process could be
              | refined through cost reduction, or not, which would drive how and where it would be
              | used. Of course, in this sense the entropy will likely grow as the ideas expand.

text          | The entropy evolution of a product over the design life is an interesting phenomenon. If
              | you have a product that you want to incrementally improve, you would need to step back
              | some number of “computation” steps to find a sufficiently flexible design space (with
              | more entropy) that allows you to move forward with a slightly different instantiation

text          | For engineering design we are interested mainly in post-diction. Post-diction is the
              | forward use of information to increase the knowledge of another actor in a strictly
              | subsequent time state. The initiator’s message is based on his current state, and the
              | receiver interprets it according to what the receiver knows. (Note that this is the inverse
              | direction to prediction (coding) wherein one could compute the desired resolution or
              | scale that the sender should use.) The mutual information I(y/\x) is simply the difference
              | between input information I(x) and the conditional information I(x|y) or I(y) and I(y|x).
              | The quality of the information received by Actor Y (at a subsequent time i + n) will be a
              | function of the accuracy of coding I(x|y) given I(x/\y). Thus

              | 
text          | Mutual information I(xi/\yi) is not static, and actors’ mutual information will decrease
              | over time if not refreshed or synchronized. This can be thought of as the actors evolving
              | separately, starting to use different materials, using different design lingo [Leifer 1999],
              | or even working on different programs or products.

              | 
text          | Given our logarithmic definition of information, we note that mutual information decays
              | to zero on the order(log r) time steps, where r is the resolution of the information.
              | Statically, without refresh, I(x/\y) will naturally approach 0 on orders similar to product
              | life, material life, and/or component life. This is similar to having a design use a
              | particular Digital Signal Processor (DSP) that goes out of production and must now be
              | replaced with a different technology. For our community, this is on the order of 5 to 12
              | years for aerospace type products. This will be discussed more later.

              | 
text          | When I(x/\y) reaches zero, it creates a wall within the complex (design community)
              | where information is not flowing. This has several effects. For one, it reduces the
              | computational efficiency of the organization. For another, it effectively creates separate,
              | competing sub-complexes. In a small scale industry this could be good as it maintains a
              | vibrant population of new small businesses. For our very large systems within our
              | constrained resources, this is not good. A third side effect that may occur as a result of

              | recognized, it would have to be reabsorbed with the concomitant costs of re-training.

title         | 3.3.1 Variety and Information Processing
text          | Variety is defined as the set of actions needed by an actor to execute an activity, where an
              | actor can be an individual, a group of individuals, or a group of groups. The set of
              | actions includes information gathering, information creation and processing, distribution
              | of resultant information, self control, and environmental interaction with other actors.
              | Executing a task requires an actor to have sufficient variety to perform all of the
              | component activity required to execute the task.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | It is conventional to measure variety, like information, in logarithmic units so that the
              | total variety of a set of independent components V=log(M) is the sum of the variety of
              | the components, V=Nv, where v=log(m).
blank         | 
              | 
text          | The key to task analysis of the variety of any system is that each of the actors has a limit
              | on its variety – the logarithm of the number of distinguishable states. Components can be
              | individuals that act in performing tasks, or individuals that manage or coordinate tasks or
              | serve as communications channels. [Bar-Yam 2004b]

text          | Assume that the design system is composed of a number of subsystems, N, that are
              | variously coordinated to respond to external contexts. The number of possible actions
              | that the system can take, M, is not more than mN, the product of the possible actions of
              | each part, m. We further constrain the problem of effective function by assuming that
              | effective actions require a sufficient variety at each scale of action corresponding to the
              | requirements for action at that scale. At every scale the variety of the system must be
              | larger than the variety necessary for the task. [Bar-Yam 2004b]

              | individual of that group, and the scale of action is just the number of individuals in that

              | number of different k-member fully coordinated groups needed to perform the entire task,
              | which therefore at a minimum requires N=kn(k) components to perform. The total
              | variety of the task is proportional to the total number of subsets of any scale V=D(k).

              | 
text          | With these assumptions, given a predetermined number of components N, the system
              | can, in the extreme, perform a task of scale N, with variety equal to that of one
              | component, or a task of scale one with variety N times as great.

              | 
text          | More generally the equation Nv=kD(k) can be considered a constraint on the possible
              | behaviour patterns (sum rule) of a system due to different mechanisms of organization. It
              | is often convenient to think about the variety of a system, V(k), that has a scale k or
              | larger, as this is the set of possible actions that can have at least that scale,

              | 
text          | Then the total variety of the system is V(1), and the sum rule can be written as:

text          | This equation “describes the existence of a tradeoff between variety at different scales.
              | Increasing the variety at one scale by changing the organizational form must come at the
              | expense of variety at other scales.” [Bar-Yam 2004 p.19]

text          | Hierarchical systems have performance limits. Scale-free organizations avoid these

title         | 3.4.1 Dynamical Systems and the Logistics Map
text          | Dynamical systems evolve over time. The composition/capabilities evolve as a function
              | of the previous state. One model of interest representing this behaviour is the logistic
              | equation. “The logistic equation (sometimes called the Verhulst model, logistic map, or
              | logistic growth curve) is a model of population growth first published by Pierre Verhulst
              | [Verhulst 1838]. The Verhulst model is continuous in time, but a modification of the
              | continuous equation to a discrete quadratic recurrence equation is also known as the
              | logistic model.” [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogisticEquation.html] The logistic
              | map is the name given to one particularly useful way of expressing the logistic model:
blank         | 
              | 
text          |                nt+1 = (birthrate – deathrate)[knt – nt2]/k
blank         | 
              | 
text          | where nt is the population at the current generation and k is the carrying capacity. To
              | derive the logistic map from this model, let
              |                xt = nt/k, and
              |                a = (information creation rate – information annihilation rate)
              | to get the map posed as a simple iteration:

              |

blank         | 
              | 
text          | Note that xt is a fraction of the carrying capacity (from the population model). For us,
              | this is the amount of the original information that is still understandable over the passage
              | of time as t --> t + 1. The variable ‘a’ represents the rate of net information production.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | The logistic map can be used to study the behaviour of complex systems over time as
              | they evolve. For our model of mega-design communities, the link performance between
              | two groups will evolve over time, causing the relationship of the two groups to evolve in
              | response. As each link in our quasi-scale-free community evolves according to its own
              | characteristics, the overall design community will evolve in a doubly complex fashion.

              | 
text          | Regarding information transfer between two actors, if the message received is completely
              | uncertain, the message is lost – this is often the case in chaotic systems. On the other
              | hand if all received messages appear to be the same, the recipient cannot determine what
              | message he was supposed to receive – this can occur in dissipative systems.

text          | “Dissipation and chaos have a common aspect: in both cases the dynamics makes a
              | connection between large and small scales. Chaotic dynamics amplify small differences
              | in the initial states until they reach macroscopic proportions, whereas dissipative
              | dynamics shrink differences until they vanish below the threshold of perception.” [Bais

text          |         a = = the (designed) spread rate of information. (Too high and too much non-
              |         synchronized information results in chaos; too low and dissipation (friction)
              |         slows information exchange so much that there is no growth from synergy.) (This
              |         is similar to the amplification parameter in logistics map terminology which is a
              |         combination of growth rate and death rate.) “a” is a controllable or cultivatable
              |         parameter.

text          |         r = = resolution. Information packets have behaviors related to their size divided
              |         by the resolution of the information. Packetization of the information at some
              |         resolution is related to the size of the producing group: individual researchers or
              |         other producers that have high r create so much information that the channel
              |         becomes clogged. Clumping the information (to a higher scale) lets it spread
              |         better because it rejects noise.

              | 
text          | A) Multi-scale Defined [Bar-Yam 2004b]
              | Multi-scale effects can be pictured by imagining information at different scales
              | analogously to multi-scale real numbers. “On one hand, each real number can be
              | represented by one point on the real axis – it is a one-dimensional quantity. On the other
              | hand, in the usual descriptions (decimal, binary, etc.), real numbers are represented by a
              | set of integers that stand for different scales – the scales of 1s, 10s, 100s, etc. This makes
              | sense because it reflects what happens when some x is added to x: the digits of x are
              | strongly affected for all scales finer than the scale of x, and weakly affected for coarser
              | scales. There are two [aspects] with the usual representations: first, they are
              | discontinuous: a small change on a fine scale will have no effect at all on coarser scales
              | most of the time, but a dramatic effect in rare cases (such as when 0.001 is added to
              | 0.999). This is a necessary side effect of using discrete (integer) representations on each
              | scale. Second, they do not lend themselves to simple modification under multiplication:
              | multiplication is basically a convolution of the representations of the two factors.
              | Whereas multiplications with numbers that have a simple representation in the chosen
              | base gives a shift (e.g. multiplication with 10 in the decimal representation just shifts the
              | decimal point), all other factors lead to changes throughout the scales.”

title         | B) Organization Scales
text          | For our engineering community, one instantiation of scale that can be easily recognized is
              | levels in an organizational hierarchy. Information being passed up and down the chain
              | gets compressed or expanded for delivery. Months’ worth of testing is compressed into a
              | report that the group delivers to their manager. The manager uses certain meta-aspects at
              | his level (budget spent, Intellectual Property (IP) filed, etc.) but has no visceral under-
              | standing of whether the new component is easy or hard to use, and whether it provides
              | the improved performance easily or only with great tweaking. The report may be filed in
              | an IP repository. Later, a design group looking for a new component accesses the reports
              | and tries to understand it enough to determine if they should use it in their product.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | So vertical-organization information-transfer either dissipates information (upward), or it
              | adds noise (chaos) (downward) (unless accompanied by additional (decompression)
              | information).
blank         | 
              | 
text          | An Organizational Aliasing Factor (OAF) is defined, and estimated to be on the order of
              | the relative sizes of the hierarchical groups. For instance, if a manager has ten
              | subordinates, then:
              |        OAF      = O( scale)
              |                 = O(10) – O(1)
              |                 =1
              | This factor is similar to limits on organizational controllability [Hogg 2001].

              | 
text          | C) Variety Scales
              | Cross-organization information transfer can ostensibly retain the information scale and
              | relay information at very high bandwidths without loss, although again the transfers are
              | subject to transmission effects. Cross-organization transfers are often not peer to peer,
              | and are frequently dis-intermediated by other functional groups.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | These agents are peer-to-peer agents in a weak sense as defined by Petrie [Petrie 1996].
              | In this sense they are true agents that provide generation of new information, but they are

              |

text          | weak in that they do not use standard protocols for communication. Each agent’s
              | protocols (methods) are particular to that set of agents.
              | Variety scale differences in peer to peer relations involve the definition of mutual
              | information needed for the information transfer. These scale differences can arise from
              | three variables: resolution, translation, and context.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Resolution effects occur when the information needs to be further developed to add more
              | detailed design information.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Translation effects occur when the type of information needs to be transformed. For
              | example, when a prototype’s key development focus was improving and characterizing a
              | new control system possibly using new lightweight components, and it now needs to be
              | characterized for material properties for reliability and radiation effects. The original
              | (controls) engineers may not have documented the reference information needed to start
              | to collect the information and samples for material environmental testing.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Context effects involve the environmental linkages and might include introducing
              | subcontractors and transferring between points of contact within the subcontractors
              | organization.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | We define a Variety Aliasing Factor VAF = ln(V1/V2). Here Variety Vi is estimated to be
              | linear with the number of people in the group, although other studies [BarYam 2004a]
              | have addressed fractional variety with non-linear additive effects. VAF has been
              | computed for each link in our scale-free design community as shown in (Figure 3-11).
              | Organizational aliasing factors (OAF) are included with variety aliasing factors (VAF)
              | since each half of an explicit organizational hierarchy should be designed to have the
              | correct agents to compress / decode the information packages.

              | has become conceptually fixed and the designers switch from talking with scientists to
              | talking with component vendors in order to develop a detailed design. The product team
              | will not talk with the laboratory scientists until after detailed design, manufacturing,
              | integration, test, launch, and initial operations. There may be a 12 year gap before the
              | design engineers again talk with the research team. Now, assuming the laboratory is not
              | lazy, they have been producing research reports for each of the last 12 years (600 weeks)
              | which have been ignored by the engineers. This is multi-scale aliasing (Figure 3-12).

text          | Scale factors cause received/stored information to not equal transmitted/produced
              | information. Is it noise or is it compression or aliasing? At the level of abstraction we
              | are discussing here, it does not really matter. What matters is that we have a measure of
              | the turbulence structure in the link so we can smoothly elide.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | For individual link smoothing (improvement), there are questions about what kind of
              | noise and dissipation is injected, and how can it be controlled, reduced, or avoided?
              | Inversely, how can we amplify “good” information exchange? For example, synthesizing
              | information into a report or a meeting format compresses it. In order to decompress the
              | report properly, or at least better, we may want to add the engineer’s names and phone
              | numbers, or add more hotlinks to the supporting sources.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | The time length between preparation and consumption also causes dissipation. For
              | instance, a lab engineer currently remembers how to debug his system, but 6 months later
              | he would have to refer to his documentation and think for a while and re-analyze his
              | system. This may not be adjustable, except possibly by deciding whether to use the

title         | 3.4.6 Synchronization
text          | Organizations are kept internally synchronized according to communication among the

              | similar to the evolution rate in a computing organism. A tightly coupled organization can
              | steer more quickly to adapt to changes. One could imagine that steering a big ship is not
              | as hard as steering a line of barges with a tug at one-end through as s-curve. Despite the

text          | We now interpret and expand the results of previous sections with a view to the problem
              | of optimal computation (communication) within our organization network. Given the
              | time scales of product delivery, tool evolution, and staff relocations defined earlier, how
              | do we select the size of groups, their relationships, and the type of information transfer
              | and storage (memory), such that we get “low-noise” information spread and growth
              | within the time frame of evolutionary design?

              | 
text          | Our goal is to foster a system whose dynamics are somewhat stable to perturbations and
              | slow compared to the time t. Remember that we are solving the problem of post diction,
              | not prediction, which is what gives us flexibility for genetic evolution and emergence
              | within this design organization. This is very significant. Prediction implies accurately
              | arriving at a predetermined optimal point. Determining the future specification is time-
              | consuming, and arriving at the point requires extra (control) resources. Post diction

text          | Network performance is evaluated by looking for link/information mismatch. In (Figure
              | 4-3), the red circles are evaluated for consistency. The checkmarks indicate consistent
              | link parameters and information formatting. The sad-faces indicate mismatches that will

text          | The product information aliasing factor ‘p’, related to the combination of all the time and
              | variety scale factors (Figure 3-13), can be placed into three bins:
              |                s – small (1-2)         (chaotic)
              |                m – medium (3)
              |                l – large (4-6)         (dissipative)

              | 
text          | These time regimes address the rate of change of I(x/\y) which is essentially the
              | differential growth rate (in different directions as well as vector magnitudes) of I(x) and
              | I(y). See (Figure 4-3). The ‘small’ total-aliasing region should be in the broadband
              | transfer regime (a=4). ‘Large’ (l) and ‘medium’ (m) total-aliasing factors represent
              | dissipative regions that require defined communications.

text          | To modify or adjust the aliasing, you could change the number of people on the link, or
              | change the percent of people in the transceivers (delta variety ‘receivers’) (V).

text          | The (environmental) transmission/transfer rate of information is represented by ‘a’. This

text          | The birthrate could be about 1 month in lab; or about 2 years in contracted research and
              | development (CR&D) if you assume information is transferred only when the prototype
              | is delivered. This also implies 3months for technology management reports and one year
              | for internal research and development (IR&D) management planning. The deathrate is
              | somewhat constant and could be proportional to engineering re-training rate (~5yrs).
              | Here, retraining might imply new tools, etc.

              | weeks. Between “R&D Senior Support” and “Prog Executive Staff”, a = 1 representing
              | the annual funding cycle, and the annual report. On the two links between “R&D” and
              | “CR&D Prototyping”, the teams are working shoulder to shoulder with constant
              | information exchange and a = 4. The “Operational design team” has monthly design
              | reviews with the “Engineering process control staff” for a = 3; in “Engineering Tool
              | Development”, it is rare to have a faster update rate than once per year or 50 weeks, so a

text          | Network improvements can be assessed both at the individual links and nodes, and over
              | “link-chains”. Between individual nodes, mismatches of Link parameters (p, a) indicate
              | a discontinuity, or a mismatch of Lyupanov exponents. Two nodes can improve their
              | combined performance by exchanging information more efficiently. However, fixing one
              | link may or may not improve overall system performance, although there will certainly
              | be local effects.

text          | Link-chains within the extended design community organization can be arbitrarily long.
              | This is not necessarily an adverse condition, as long as the information is not corrupted
              | and as long as the information arrives in a timely fashion. In fact, having a quasi-free
              | scale organization implies some limits on chain lengths (because of the cross
              | connections).

text          | One limit in many organizations is how internal and external research is incorporated into
              | defined programs delivering products. Delivering major products that are pre-specified
              | in contracts does not need any new research, so program managers would rather control
              | internal technology resources to solve contract problems rather than create more new
              | technologies.

              | time distribution of R&D allocation. Here, the numbers represent the percent of funds

text          | Because program managers are not receiving any immediate value from the longer term
              | investments they try to reallocate all (90%) the R&D money internal to their product
              | development and production. Since the program managers control the source of income,
              | they have a large say in how internal funds are allocated. This is more efficient for their
              | individual program, but puts the company into a weaker long-term competitive posture

text          | Two interesting side-effects emerged. One of these might have been predicted in that the

text          | Another more interesting result was the effect this had on the Engineering Subsystem
              | teams. Previously they had no responsibility for their products other than to deliver their
              | design within the particular program requirements. Now, as they were tasked to improve

title         | 5 Performance Observations and Implications
text          | A large corporation was modeled as an adaptive computing organism that creates new
              | assets (mega-platforms). We are trying to make this (organizational) computing more
              | efficient so we can get more output so we can achieve better survivability (for the
              | organization) and better social value (for the environment). This section identifies areas
              | of potential benefits and changes.

title         | 5.1 R&D Applicability Performance
text          | While emergent engineering behaviours are interesting, another question is whether this
              | improved the value to the company and/or the value delivered to the environment
              | (society). These questions may not be answerable, but one metric – the inserted value of
              | R&D efforts – rose from less than 5% to almost 80% as measured by the number of
              | research projects being fully used in an operational program.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | How well are typical research-expenditures used? This is a good question since there are
              | currently no good metrics and there is currently no generally accepted technique. People
              | have been looking for a long time, but nothing seems to work. This may be because the
              | desired answer doesn’t match the computed answer. Common methods of calculation
              | give extremely low values (<5% (?!)), indicating very low rates of return on invested
              | funds.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | In fact, it is very hard to discover any direct relation between research investments and
              | new product delivery. Many people would agree that the return on investment is mostly
              | in the experience gained by the engineers.

              | 
text          | Following the framework developed in Section 2.0 through Section 4.0 indicates that less
              | than 20% of R&D is directly useful (in the aerospace community). The research projects
              | themselves can be quite successful, but information transfer to a development program
              | runs into the problems indicated in terms of time synchronization. Reports may be

              | look to see what new technologies are available at the start of a new program. A
              | particular system and/or upgrade may start anew once every fifteen years (twelve years
              | development, plus three years of initial operations). Even within a business or product
              | area that averages three large systems in concurrent development, the average time
              | between new starts would be five years. Thus the research results for four years are put
              | on the shelf, and only in the fifth year do application engineers research new approaches
              | for their program (1/5 = 20%).

title         | 5.2 Estimating the Amount of Communication you Should Afford
text          | When you change the information transfer rate a, you must also adjust the variety at both
              | the receiving and transmitting agents. Otherwise the agents will suffer an information
              | overload, and you will still have inefficient information transfer. It may be that the cost
              | of the extra staff needed to increase the variety of the agent is more than the value of the
              | improved information transfer.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | The value of the improved information transfer is the benefit minus the cost.
              |        Value = Benefit – Cost = Benefit – (changes in variety at all nodes)
blank         | 
              | 
text          | In the simplest example, when passing information from one peer actor to another,
              | instead of vertical information transfers (up and down) through a common management
              | actor, you should simply arrange a peer transfer link. Here you wouldn’t have to pay for
              | a compression and a decompression task – you would simply pay for the variety to make
              | the original product understandable to the new actor. Assuming all encoding/decoding
              | tasks are the same and equal V, you would delete an up-link (2V) (one encode, one
              | receive) and a down-link (2V) (one transmit, and one decode), and replace it with a single
              | peer link (2V) (one transmit, one receive). So the change in value would be - (- 4 + 2)
              | which equals +2, or a 50% improvement.

text          | For the earlier example in Section 4.4.1, for the short term evaluation, the amount (cost)
              | of variety added at D (three places) must be less than or equal to the value of recovered
              | resources at A (2x) and D (two places) minus some inefficiencies and overhead costs.
              | Here the value would be +3 that is, again, about a 50% improvement. This value change
              | may be different for “translation” and “context” effects (cf. Section 3.4.3). More detail
              | could be developed by using a fine-grained organizational model with fractional values
              | for all actors and all types of variety.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Average adjustments of variety will be close to a net-zero effect, compared to the goal
              | benefit, so variety cost savings will neither help nor hinder the justification for any
              | planned improvement in communication. This is reasonable since the improvements are
              | designed to improve a meta-level of activity for the organization.

title         | 5.3 Expected Product Changes
text          | Increased information transfer regarding new technologies and validated prototypes will
              | enable more rapid design of aerospace products and a more rapid growth of the aerospace
              | environment through two pathways: Delivery Date Export, and Incremental Technology
              | Incorporation. A representative cumulative effect is shown in (Figure 5-1). The x-axis is
              | time, measured in years, and the y-axis is capacity or social value, measured in some
              | combination of dollars, performance, quality, or similar metric. The bottom curve is the
              | status quo showing growth in social value in 12 year steps. A current system of this type
              | might be the GPS satellite network or the Air Traffic Control system. The top curve
              | shows the potential value of a system evolution using system engineering methods such
              | as evolutionary design [Bobinis 2006] or flow-service-quality engineering [Linger 2002]
              | to improve the efficiency and rate of delivery. Methods to cultivate the incremental
              | pathways (within these methods) are discussed below. This is consistent with

title         | 5.3.1 Exporting Products at Delivery Dates
text          | Exporting products at predefined delivery dates is similar to design-to-schedule and
              | design-to-cost efforts. However, instead of pre-defining a goal and then forcing your
              | design to achieve it, you define a set of interfaces and boundary conditions, and deliver
              | within those constraints. This requires some inefficient margins (initially), but as you
              | reuse the base design for subsequent products, you can focus on improving the various
              | performance parameters without spending time on the interface. So within a couple of
              | iterations you will have improved total performance with less cost.

              | automated design tools had to use inefficient circuit designs to enable automated layout
              | and automated test. But the lower cost, compared to hand layouts, enabled greater sales,

text          | Engineers can, and will, allow for design growth with exported products at delivery dates,

title         | 5.4 Limits to Change
text          | Given this new perspective, and the apparent small scale of individual changes, how far
              | can you go? There are certainly limits to improvement, most basically from the external
              | environment’s ability to incorporate changes at a stable rate.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Another restriction, or basic conceptual limit, is that there is no right answer and no
              | optimal solution. In fact trying to find an overall solution is diametrically opposite from
              | the direction taken here: that you try to improve the organization to more easily
              | incorporate engineer’s capabilities. And, although many engineers say that “better is the
              | enemy of good enough”, here you are not waiting to become perfect before you move
              | forward, you are independently improving engineering efficiency in parallel with
              | delivering your products.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Likewise, there are costs associated with change. Changes in organizations and in
              | policies and procedures take time and effort to implement. You probably can only
              | change one link at a time. Also, if you change all the links at once, you would lose
              | ‘communicativity’ and your organization would collapse.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Finally, you don’t want to change too fast. In this case you will have incurred the costs
              | of change without having looked ahead to see where external changes (and your changes)
              | have affected the environment in which you are working. You may want to reprioritize
              | your cultivation so you don’t overshoot.

text          | At what scale does this dissonant behaviour manifest? It was stated earlier that mega-
              | systems require on the order of 10,000 man-years of design time; that the total involved

              | 5,000 working groups at the various individual program levels. From a bottom-up
              | perspective, there could be 200,000 information pathways given the number of people
              | involved and the required task variety. The exact number is problematic, both to actually

text          | Simple organizations and simple activity networks have high ‘a’ (3.5 – 4.0). Information
              | transfer is chaotic in the sense that it is immediate, complete, and very high bandwidth.
              | Imagine a very small company with a team of 5 working in a single room to design and
              | produce a single part for a machine. Each knows what the other is doing, they can
              | communicate verbally, and all the information is in the room including the supplier
              | catalogs, CNC settings, account ledger, etc. So development and production is straight
              | forward. The major risk for information loss is if one of the people is sick for a day:
              | since nothing was documented, you would have to wait for his return, or simply
              | regenerate the information.

              | 
text          | As the company size increases, there are more people, more rooms, and even more
              | buildings. Task assignments must be better planned and information flow must be better
              | documented. Things are less chaotic and more structured. Information is becoming
              | somewhat static, and must now be delivered explicitly. ‘a’ is approaching 3.0 or less.
              | Depending on how busy the shop is, some production tasks may get temporarily lost; or
              | possibly an invoice not given to finance to be paid. But these are small effects, and given
              | that the teams are well organized, have good processes, and understand the overall effort,
              | no big problems arise. It is not quite as efficient as before since now you need design
              | reviews, manufacturing readiness reviews, quality control, etc., but now you can address
              | larger efforts, delivering entire machines and getting the higher profits due the extra
              | complexity.

              | 
text          | At some point the time synchronization becomes problematic. Possibly because the next
              | use of information is indeterminate at the time of production, possibly because of
              | physical separation, or because of a number of reasons. Efforts to not lose information
              | become important: documenting fabrication improvements to feedback to design;
              | creating reusable components and product families; transferring consistent customer
              | requirements to different sub-organizations. This is the dissipative zone (a ~1.5) and care
              | must be taken to avoid slowing the design and production process, and becoming a
              | lethargic organization.

              | organization and processes provides more opportunities for information aliasing – both
              | from noise injection and from dissipation. Any organization, no matter what its size, sees
              | these effects. The bigger the organization, the bigger the size of the effects, and the more
              | valuable it is to adjust for smoother dynamics.

              | capital equipment), problems can be injected. This implies there is (at least) one, or a set
              | of activities that are single use within the design of a mega-system. When these are
              | applied to the next megasystem, their system context is essentially not cleared. This
              | might imply an additional type of aliasing, sort of like a feed-forward echo.

title         | 6 Conclusions
text          | This dissertation developed a new type of model for extremely large design organizations
              | and their environment by combining perspectives from:
              |         -   evolutionary genetic computing organisms,
              |         -   information theoretic (quantum) information production, and
              |         -   non-linear dynamics and chaos theory for information exchange.
              | to study some of the behaviours of complex organizations, especially information
              | transfer, to show how organizations can be guided to more efficiently and quickly
              | produce complex mega-systems.

title         | 6.1 More Efficient Design of Mega-Systems
text          | Ignoring the quality of information transfer among organizational elements causes
              | significant inefficiencies. The transfer quality includes time synchronization, method of
              | transfer, and other variables. It is not that anything is currently wrong, just that a lot of
              | time is wasted waiting for information, translating information, or re-developing the
              | context to understand the information, and additional time (and resources) may be spent
              | waiting for task convergence. Matching the characteristics of the product design
              | information to the characteristics of the transfer path minimizes aliasing effects
              | (dissipation and noise), creating many benefits including:
              |         -   More efficient design and design execution,

text          | Improvements in the performance of the organization will incrementally emerge, given
              | the inertia of large organizations and of engineering processes, and will initially manifest
              | as quicker deliveries and an accelerating ability to innovate ahead of other companies.

text          | “One consequence of encoding information as statistical and time-varying patterns of
              | low-level components is that no individual component of the system can perceive or
              | communicate the ‘big-picture’ of the state of the system. Instead, information must be
              | communicated via spatial and temporal sampling.” [Mitchell 2009] Dynamically, the
              | mega-design process is progressing, and any snapshot is an incomplete view in a
              | changing context. This implies that the product directors can’t really direct or control
              | where the company is going: their role should only be to monitor the outputs and nascent
              | products, and guide the output (and rate of new product introduction and of upgrades) to
              | match the funding (requirements) source. This would balance control and efficiency.

              | the name of niche construction. … [Here], the selective filter is partially constructed by
              | the organism itself, and exerts an influence over a locally reproducing population. … In
              | this way, adaptations lift themselves up by their own bootstraps.” [Krakauer 2011].

              | 2011], for better computability or production of designs. In this case, the management
              | structure ought to also look at higher level abstractions, such as information transfer
              | efficiencies, in addition to process control (like design reviews), because looking at static

              | systems), has side effects on the engineering design process. Financially speaking, and
              | for more effective mega-system development, the government should modify cost-
              | selection constraints to avoid extra effort to achieve a particular instance when any of a

              | risk reduction. For instance the Orion spacecraft program internally allocated $100M

              | approach. However, it was implemented without adjusting the encompassing process, so
              | savings could never be recaptured, nor future transitions eased. This fund would reduce

title         | 7.1 Evolutionary Design
text          | Evolutionary design includes functions of complex systems that allow us to discover,
              | measure, and implement design activities during the entire life cycle of a system. It
              | assumes that we cannot know all the functions of deployed complex systems, and that an
              | evolutionary approach to design, is required. Several unique design methods were added
              | to the system engineering repertoire, including incremental engineering by which
              | portions of the system are redesigned and operate in parallel to other parts of the system.
              | Bar-Yam suggests that spiral development is an instantiation, (although simplified), of
              | evolutionary acquisition and design. “Recent extensions that adopt some complex
              | systems ideas include spiral development and evolutionary acquisition and adaptive
              | programming. A complex systems perspective provides a large conceptual framework –
              | evolution-from which to understand how incremental change can enable rapid
              | innovation.” [Bar-Yam 2003].

              | 
text          | Evolutionary design implies that since we cannot iteratively account for all functions and
              | processes of complex systems, we must provide a design process which allows us to
              | inductively determine system behaviors and processes, after the system is fielded. Spiral
              | design engineering, is really just a traditional design methodology which is repeated
              | recursively over the entire life cycle of the system. But it does account for all the
              | interfaces, transactions, and controls of a complex system that cannot be known during
              | initial design. Through this process, we can apply traditional methods in changing small

              | systems, parts of the system may be known and tested, and replaced through traditional
              | planning, specification and implementation. Evolutionary design implies that on-going
              | discovery and re-design is a life cycle function of the system. The system must have a
              | means of monitoring its own “state”. An example of this, might be the modern
              | application of prognostics in complex platforms, where system states can be collected,
              | analyzed, and understood to the extent that we are provided the “patterns of system

              | “When taking the classical view, a major fault cited with Systems engineering is that it

              | system. It starts at a functional analysis of user based operations and interfaces the
              | system services function needs to support all users (human or other systems). By
              | mapping the interchanges with the supported “users”, the system services function can
              | analyze system, as well as sub-system, states. It also defines the standards and protocols

              | design, and that the primary hub “system services” has specific sub-functions that
              | account for growth (new nodes), and reorganization (once added, the types of information
              | shared across nodes). It’s ability to account for nodes as they are added, the type of
              | requests of these unique nodes, the mapping and storage of system topology, in near real-

title         | 7.4 Engineering Tools
text          | Some studies that examined the engineering process have focused on tools developed to
              | improve product design by engineering teams [Leifer 1999]. Here the tools fall into three
              | classes: interpersonal communication, knowledge capture, and knowledge retrieval.
              | Productivity gains have been shown when design teams can begin from a better starting
              | point as a result of having access to learned information from previous designs.
              | “In larger organizations, the complexity is vastly different and the chance for deep
              | personal co-commitment is diminished. Ad hoc exchanges within one’s personal
              | network do happen, but systematic knowledge sharing usually requires brokering through
              | people or technology. Along with brokering come issues such as knowledge
              | identification, verification, and validation [Leifer 1999].”
blank         | 
              | 
text          | “[All organizations] can benefit from the implementation of a central knowledge capture
              | and re-use infrastructure, a core technology for sharing and learning from each other,
              | peer-to-peer. In large institutions (greater that 500 people) this infrastructure will have to
              | be explicit and managed separately from the design team support infrastructure [Leifer
              | 1999].”
blank         | 
              | 
text          | A separate explicit infrastructure however becomes problematic, especially on projects
              | with long time scales (~10 years). Issues arise that interfere with having a consistent
              | structure. The portfolio of projects across a large organization use different engineering
              | tools. This will always be true because of a mismatch of time frequencies between new
              | tools and new projects, and the fact you can’t and don’t want to update your tools all at
              | once on a preordained schedule. Also engineers bring different sets of tool knowledge
              | with them to new projects. It actually takes some finite time for a team to get
              | synchronized on common tools and data structures. Also most training is done on the job

              | not always used as they were designed, nor to their full potential. Finally, retrieval of old
              | knowledge becomes problematic and time consuming, and may become moot as different
              | technologies advance at different rates, opening up new solution spaces for consideration.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Another issue arising from large organizations that affects knowledge retention and
              | retrieval is that engineering team members do not usually follow a project from
              | conception through design, manufacture, production, maintenance, and growth.
              | Typically, engineers focus on one stage of design. Therefore the information associated
              | with a project bifurcates, with one instance progressing with the product as the product
              | “design” and “context”, and the other instance going with the engineer or data base to a
              | new product at a similar stage as “knowledge”.
